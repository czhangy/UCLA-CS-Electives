- Two Kinds of Morphology

  - Most linguists acknowledge at least a rough distinction between two kinds of morphology

    - Word formation vs. inflectional morphology
    - Complementary with each other

  - **Word-formation** = a system of rules used to expand the stock of words, by forming new words from old

    - Also called **derivational morphology** or **derivation**

  - **Inflectional morphology** = system of rules used to encode *grammatical features*

  - Example:

    - |    `tavol-o` - table     |    `tavol-i` - tables     |
      | :----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
      | `tavol-on-e` - big table | `tavol-on-i` - big tables |

    - `e` vs. `i` encodes the grammatical nature of singular/plural => inflectional morphology

    - `on` encodes "big" => word-formation

      - **Augmentative** = to make bigger
      - **Diminutive** = to make smaller

- Inflectional Morphology

  - Examples:
    - Tense on verbs
      - Ex) Present tense (`love-s`) vs. past tense (`jump-ed`)
    - Number on nouns
      - Ex) Singular (`pie`) vs. plural (`pie-s`)
    - Person and number agreement in verbs
      - Ex) She `love-s` vs. they `love`
    - Subject/nominative forms vs. object/accusative forms
      - Ex) she vs. her, he vs. him, I vs. me, etc.

- Morphological Analysis

  - In order to make sense of any newly encountered language, we also need to figure out the structure of the morphology
  - How?
    - Gathering data
    - Determining what morphemes are present
    - Writing the rules that form the words from their constituent morphemes
  - Method for morphological analysis:
    - Compile a collection of morphologically similar words and their meanings
    - Scrutinize it to determine which phoneme sequences remain the same whenever the meaning remains the same
    - Isolate the meaningful chunks (i.e., morphemes)
  - Typical cases in languages:
    - **Nominative** = usually for subjects of sentences or the citation form of the word
    - **Accusative** = usually for (direct) objects of words
    - **Dative** = conveying the notion of "to" in English
    - **Locative** = conveying the notion of "at", "in", "on", etc.
  - In LING 105, we become *confident* with analyzing examples from several languages
    - We need to know how to *analyze morphosyntactic elements*
    - We need to use the **Leipzig Glossing Rules** to gloss our examples
    - We need to translate examples into English
      - Languages with a rich inflectional morphology are more challenging to gloss

- Segmentation

  - Some words are easily segmented and broken up into individually meaningful parts
    - These parts are called morphemes

- Morphemes

  - **Morphemes**: the smallest meaningful constituents of a linguistic expression
  - Morphemes are the ultimate elements of morphological analysis; the morphological "atoms"
  - Some words cannot be segmented into morphemes
    - Such words are "the", "therefore", etc.
    - These words are **mono-morphemic**

- Lexemes vs. Word-Forms

  - **Lexeme** = a word in an abstract sense
    - A mental representation
    - Ex) "live" is a **verb lexeme**
      - It represents the *core meaning* shared by forms such as "live", "lives", "lived", and "living"
    - Dictionaries are organized according to lexemes
      - It's useful to think of a lexeme as a "dictionary word"
    - Lexemes are abstract entities that have no phonological form of their own
      - `LIVE` is just a convenient label to talk about a particular lexeme
  - **Word-form** = a word in a concrete sense
    - How we use it
    - A concrete sequence of sounds that expresses the combination of a lexeme (e.g., `LIVE`) and a set of grammatical meanings (or grammatical functions) appropriate to that lexeme
    - e.g., third-person singular present tense = "lives", past tense = "lived"
      - "lives" and "lived" are *word-forms*

- Word Family

  - Different lexemes may also be related to each other, and a set of related lexemes is sometimes called a word family
    - Ex) "Read", "readable", "unreadable", etc.

- Paradigms

  - Lexemes can be thought of as sets of word-forms

    - The word-forms "live", "lived", "lives", and "living" all belong to the lexeme `LIVE`

  - Word-forms belonging to the same lexeme express *different grammatical functions*, but the same core concept

  - In the most interesting case, lexemes consist of a fair number of word-forms

  - The set of word-forms that belongs to a lexeme is often called a **paradigm**

  - Ex) Paradigm of the Latin noun "insula" (island):

    - |    Case    | Singular |  Plural   |
      | :--------: | :------: | :-------: |
      | Nominative |  insula  |  insulae  |
      | Accusative | insulam  |  insulās  |
      |  Genitive  | insulae  | insulārum |
      |   Dative   | insulae  |  insulīs  |
      |  Ablative  |  insulā  |  insulīs  |
