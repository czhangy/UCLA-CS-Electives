Nothing to see here!



## Lecture 2: Syntactic Topology and Universals

- Two Kinds of Morphology

  - Most linguists acknowledge at least a rough distinction between two kinds of morphology

    - Word formation vs. inflectional morphology
    - Complementary with each other

  - **Word-formation** = a system of rules used to expand the stock of words, by forming new words from old

    - Also called **derivational morphology** or **derivation**

  - **Inflectional morphology** = system of rules used to encode *grammatical features*

  - Example:

    - |    `tavol-o` - table     |    `tavol-i` - tables     |
      | :----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
      | `tavol-on-e` - big table | `tavol-on-i` - big tables |

    - `e` vs. `i` encodes the grammatical nature of singular/plural => inflectional morphology

    - `on` encodes "big" => word-formation

      - **Augmentative** = to make bigger
      - **Diminutive** = to make smaller

- Inflectional Morphology

  - Examples:
    - Tense on verbs
      - Ex) Present tense (`love-s`) vs. past tense (`jump-ed`)
    - Number on nouns
      - Ex) Singular (`pie`) vs. plural (`pie-s`)
    - Person and number agreement in verbs
      - Ex) She `love-s` vs. they `love`
    - Subject/nominative forms vs. object/accusative forms
      - Ex) she vs. her, he vs. him, I vs. me, etc.

- Morphological Analysis

  - In order to make sense of any newly encountered language, we also need to figure out the structure of the morphology
  - How?
    - Gathering data
    - Determining what morphemes are present
    - Writing the rules that form the words from their constituent morphemes
  - Method for morphological analysis:
    - Compile a collection of morphologically similar words and their meanings
    - Scrutinize it to determine which phoneme sequences remain the same whenever the meaning remains the same
    - Isolate the meaningful chunks (i.e., **morphemes**)
  - Typical cases in languages:
    - **Nominative** = usually for subjects of sentences or the citation form of the word
    - **Accusative** = usually for (direct) objects of words
    - **Dative** = conveying the notion of "to" in English
    - **Locative** = conveying the notion of "at", "in", "on", etc.
  - In LING 105, we become *confident* with analyzing examples from several languages
    - We need to know how to *analyze morphosyntactic elements*
    - We need to use the **Leipzig Glossing Rules** to gloss our examples
