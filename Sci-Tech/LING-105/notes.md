- Two Kinds of Morphology

  - Most linguists acknowledge at least a rough distinction between two kinds of morphology

    - Word formation vs. inflectional morphology
    - Complementary with each other

  - **Word-formation** = a system of rules used to expand the stock of words, by forming new words from old

    - Also called **derivational morphology** or **derivation**

  - **Inflectional morphology** = system of rules used to encode *grammatical features*

  - Example:

    - |    `tavol-o` - table     |    `tavol-i` - tables     |
      | :----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
      | `tavol-on-e` - big table | `tavol-on-i` - big tables |

    - `e` vs. `i` encodes the grammatical nature of singular/plural => inflectional morphology

    - `on` encodes "big" => word-formation

      - **Augmentative** = to make bigger
      - **Diminutive** = to make smallerc
