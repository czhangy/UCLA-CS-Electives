## Lecture 1: Introduction and Anatomy

- Introduction
  - What is Linguistics?
    - The study of human language
    - Our ability to learn and use a human language constitutes a profound biological mystery
  - Why Study Human Language?
    - The complexity of human language is obscured by how effortless it is:
      - When you see an object, your brain automatically transforms the light waves that hit your retina into the colors, shapes, etc. that you perceive, without any conscious effort on your part and you being aware of these computations
      - When you hear a sentence of a language that you speak, you immediately and effortlessly understand it, largely without conscious effort and awareness of the computation
        - This doesn't mean there isn't a lot going on to our use of language
  - An Example
    - "The pink elephant in my pajamas is dancing on the grass"
    - Puts a thought into our heads, simply by making sounds and/or putting shapes on the screen
    - As speakers of English, we automatically convert these sounds/shapes into meaning
  - Key Question
    - What knowledge do speakers of a language have that allows them to do this?
  - Aspects of This Knowledge
    - It is abstract and unconscious
      - Converting sounds into meaning "happens" automatically in your head, you have no conscious thought of the process
    - It is rapid and automatic
      - When you hear an English sentence, you can't help but understand it virtually immediately
  - Abstractness of Grammatical Knowledge
    - Speakers typically have very specific intuitions that can differ clearly between very similar linguistic structures
      - "Mary is easy to please."
        - Mary is the one who is pleased
      - "Mary is eager to please."
        - Mary is doing the pleasing
      - "Deborah expected to surprise her."
        - "her" != Deborah
      - "Who did Deborah expect to surprise her?"
        - "her" ?= Deborah
  - Key Question
    - What is the unconscious knowledge that speakers of a language have that allows them to do this?
    - A wrong answer: a speaker of a language has simply memorized all the sentences of that language and what they mean
      - Cannot be the case because you can understand sentences you haven't heard before (~70% of the sentences you hear)
  - The Role of Rules
    - There is an infinite number of English sentences that you can understand, even if you have ever heard them before
    - Not just every string of English words is a sentence of English (ungrammatical)
    - It is not just the combination of words into sentences that is governed by rules, the same is true for the combination of sounds
  - Upshot
    - Even if you have never heard a sequence of words before, you know whether it is a sentence of English or not
    - When you know a language, you know
      - A list of basic expressions (words, sounds, etc.)
      - A combinatory system of rules that allow you to put them together
  - Language as it is, not as it "should be"
    - As scientists, linguists are interested in the real world
      - As such, they are interested in the rules that speakers of a language actually do follow
      - They aren't interested in the rules that some people think speakers should follow
    - Stranding prepositions, splitting infinitives, passive voice, double negatives, etc.
    - A linguist treats all varieties of all languages as equally valuable
    - A linguist will never tell a native speaker of a language that they should or shouldn't talk in a particular way
  - Conclusion
    - What you know when you know a human language
      - A memorized set of basic expressions
      - A set of rules for combining these basic expressions
    - Linguists are interested in discovering these rules
    - Big question: what is the system of rules and expressions that underlies our ability to speak and understand a human language?
- Vocal-Tract Anatomy
  - The Tongue
    - Tip of the tongue
    - Blade (or front) of the tongue
    - Body (or back) of the tongue
  - The Larynx
    - In the middle of your throat is the larynx
    - Inside your larynx are muscles called the vocal folds
    - The opening between the vocal folds is the glottis
      - The vocal folds have the ability to open and close the glottis
        - When the glottis is closed, air can't leave the lungs
        - When the glottis is open, air freely leaves the lungs
      - When the vocal folds come so close together that they are almost closed, they vibrate
        - This vibration is your voice
  - The Velum
    - The soft area at the very back of your mouth is your velum
    - It is the doorway to the nasal passage
    - If it is lowered, air can go into the nasal cavity and out the nose
    - If it is raised, air has to go through your mouth
  - The (Hard) Palate
    - The (hard) palate is the hardest area of the roof of your mouth
    - Just in front of the velum
  - The Alveolar Ridge
    - The fleshy ridge just behind your top teeth is the alveolar ridge
  - The Post-Alveolar Region
    - The area between your palate and your alveolar ridge is the post-alveolar (or alveo-palatal) region
    - The area where the roof of your mouth rises sharply
  - The Teeth
    - The teeth are involved in making some speech sounds ("th", "f", etc.)
  - The Lips
    - The lips are involved in making speech sounds ("f", "p", "m", etc.)
  - The Problem with Spelling
    - In order to talk about sounds, we need a way of representing them in written form
    - Why not use English spelling to represent sounds?
      - English spelling is often ambiguous
        - Same sound, different spelling: their, there, they're
        - Same spelling, different sound: read, bow, roof
      - Some sounds don't have a designated symbol: (th)orn, (th)is, si(ng), etc.
    - Other languages have sounds that English lacks and therefore English doesn't have a symbol for; for example:
      - ñ in Spanish
      - ‘ in Hawaiian
      - đ in Vietnamese
      - ch or ö in German
  - International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
    - Developed over 100 years ago by the International Phonetic Association
    - Unambiguous: 1 symbol per sound, 1 sound per symbol
    - Universal: all known human phones represented
    - Many symbols used in the IPA are the same symbols used in our orthography (spelling)
      - These aren't the same thing!
    - If a symbol is from the IPA, it is enclosed in square brackets
    - When speech is represented in the IPA, we say that we are forming a phonetic transcription



## Lecture 2: Consonants and Vowels

- Consonants
  - Main parameters for describing consonants
    - Manner of articulation
      - How the gesture in the vocal tract occurs
      - Stops/Plosives: sounds that create a complete blockade in the oral tract
        - Bilabial stops
          - `[p]`: bilabial, voiceless, oral (<u>p</u>an)
          - `[b]`: bilabial, voiced, oral (<u>b</u>an)
          - `[m]`: bilabial, voiced, nasal (<u>m</u>an)
        - Alveolar stops

          - `[d]`: alveolar, voiced, oral (<u>D</u>an)
          - `[n]`: alveolar, voiced, nasal (Da<u>n</u>)
          - `[ɾ]`: alveolar, voiced, oral, tap/flap (le<u>tt</u>er)

          - `[ŋ]`: velar, voiced, nasal (si<u>ng</u>)
        - Glottal stop
          - `[ʔ]`: glottal, voiceless, oral (<u>u</u>h-<u>o</u>h)
          - Always voiceless
      - Fricatives: produced by creating a radical narrowing in the oral tract
        - Through that radical narrow, a turbulence in the air-flow is created that makes a characteristic "hissing" sound
        - Bilabial fricatives
          - `[ɸ]`: bilabial, voiceless, oral (<u>F</u>uji)
          - `[β]`: bilabial, voiced, oral (de<u>b</u>er)
          - Don't exist in English
        - Labio-dental fricatives
          - `[f]`: labio-dental, voiceless, oral (<u>f</u>an)
          - `[v]`: labio-dental, voiced, oral (<u>v</u>an)
        - Dental fricatives
          - `[θ]`: dental, voiceless, oral (<u>th</u>igh)
          - `[ð]`: dental, voiced, oral (<u>th</u>e)
        - Alveolar fricatives
          - `[s]`: alveolar, voiceless, oral (<u>s</u>ip)
          - `[z]`: alveolar, voiced, oral (<u>z</u>ip)
        - Post-alveolar fricatives
          - `[ʃ]`: post-alveolar, voiceless, oral (mi<u>ss</u>ion)
          - `[ʒ]`: post-alveolar, voiced, oral (vi<u>s</u>ion)
        - Glottal fricative
          - `[h]`: glottal, voiceless, oral (<u>h</u>eap)
      - Affricates: produced as a stop that is released into a fricative
        - Sometimes treated as a single speech sound
        - In this class, treated as the combination of two sounds
        - `[tʃ]`: alveo-palatal, voiceless, oral (<u>ch</u>ump)
        - `[dʒ]`: alveo-palatal, voiced, oral (<u>J</u>ump)
      - Approximants: involve a less radial narrowing in the oral tract than is found with fricatives, but greater than is found with vowels
        - For this reason, often called semi-vowels
        - Labial approximants
          - `[w]`: labio-velar, voiced, oral (<u>w</u>in)
        - Alveolar approximants
          - `[l]`: alveolar, voiced, oral, lateral (<u>l</u>ed)
          - `[ɹ]`: alveolar, voiced, oral (<u>r</u>ed)
        - Palatal approximants
          - `[j]`: palatal, voiced, oral (<u>y</u>es)
    - Place of articulation
      - Where in the vocal tract the gesture occurs
    - Nasality
      - Whether or not the velum is lowered, allowing vibrating air into the nasal cavity
      - Nasal: the velum is lowered so the air flows into the nasal cavity
      - Oral/Non-nasal: the velum is raised so the air doesn't flow into the nasal cavity
      - The nasal sounds of English:
        - `[n]` (ba<u>n</u>)
        - `[m]` (ba<u>m</u>)
        - `[ŋ]` (ba<u>ng</u>)
        - These sounds are all voiced
    - Voicing
      - Whether or not the vocal folds are vibrating while the sound is being made
      - Voiced: vocal folds vibrate while the sound is being made
      - Voiceless: vocal folds don't vibrate while the sound is being made
      - English has many pairs of consanants that only differ in voicing:
        - `[s]` vs. `[z]` (<u>s</u>ip vs. <u>z</u>ip)
        - `[f]` vs. `[v]` (<u>f</u>at vs. <u>v</u>at)
        - `[θ]` vs. `[ð]` (<u>th</u>igh vs. <u>th</u>y)
        - `[ʃ]` vs. `[ʒ]` (mi<u>ss</u>ion vs. vi<u>s</u>ion)
        - `[tʃ]` vs. `[dʒ]` (<u>ch</u>ump vs. <u>J</u>ump)
        - `[p]` vs. `[b]` (<u>p</u>at vs. <u>b</u>at)
        - `[t]` vs. `[d]` (<u>t</u>ip vs. <u>d</u>ip)
        - `[k]` vs. `[g]` (<u>c</u>ap vs. <u>G</u>ap)
- Vowels
  - A vowel is a speech sound that is articulated while the vocal tract is completely open
  - There is no air pressure build-up at any point above the glottis
  - Parameters for describing vowels
    - Tongue position
      - Height: height of the tongue's highest point in the mouth
        - Distance between the tongue and the roof of the mouth
        - h<u>ea</u>t (high) vs. h<u>oo</u>t (low)
      - Backness: how far back in the mouth is the tongue position
        - h<u>ea</u>t (front) vs. h<u>oo</u>t (back)
        - Front vowels
          - `[i]`: high, unrounded, tense (b<u>ee</u>t)
          - `[ɪ]`: high, unrounded, lax (b<u>i</u>t)
          - `[e]`: mid, unrounded, tense (d<u>e</u>ber)
          - `[ɛ]`: mid, unrounded, lax (r<u>e</u>d)

          - `[ʊ]`: high, rounded, lax (p<u>u</u>t)
          - `[o]`: mid, rounded, tense (perr<u>o</u>)
          - `[ɔ]`: mid, rounded, lax (<u>o</u>range)
          - `[ʌ]`: mid, unrounded, lax (c<u>u</u>t)
          - `[ɑ]`: low, unrounded, tense (c<u>o</u>t)
    - Rounding of lips
      - Rounded vs. Unrounded
      - Are the lips rounded while the vowel is produced?
      - h<u>ea</u>t (unrounded) vs. h<u>oo</u>t (rounded)
    - Tenseness
      - Tense
        - Produced with greater muscle tension
        - Usually longer
      - Lax
        - Produced with less muscle tension
        - Usually shorter
  - Diphthongs
    - All the vowels we have seen so far are pure vowels
      - There is no noticeable change in the quality of the vowel over the course of the production
    - A second group of vowels is called diphthongs
      - The vowel ends differently than it starts
      - Diphthongs are basically a combination of two vowels, or a vowel and a glide, with a gradual transition between them
    - Front diphthongs

      - `[aj]`: low, front, unrounded (<u>i</u>ce)
      - `[aw]`: low, front, rounded (bl<u>ou</u>se)
    - Back diphthongs
      - `[ow]`: mid, back, rounded (b<u>oa</u>t)
      - `[ɔj]`: mid, back, rounded (b<u>oy</u>)



## Lecture 3: Syllable Structure and Phonotactics

- Syllables
  - When we pronounce words like "understanding", we do not just pronounce them as a simple string of sounds
  - Rather, the sounds are grouped into syllables
  - Syllable boundaries are indicated in the IPA with a period `[.]`
  - Examples:
    - `[ʌn.dɨɹ.stæn.dɪŋ]`
    - `[ɹɛ.kɹi. ͡eȷ.ʃən]`
    - `[bʌ.l ͡ow.ni]`
  - Syllables are Fixed
    - Native speakers of a language have clear intuitions about where syllable breaks can and cannot occur
  -  Syllables are Rule-Governed
    - Question: is it possible that speakers have simply memorized the syllable breaks for all the words of a language?
      - No, speakers have clear intuitions about syllable breaks in words that they have never seen before and even more nonce words (strings of sounds that could be words in a language but happen not to be)
    - Conclusion: the placement of syllables is not memorized, but instead is the result of a regular process, i.e., a rule
    - Refresher: when you know a language, you know:
      - A finite set of basic elements
        - What sounds does a word consist of?
      - A set of rules for combining basic elements (i.e., a grammar)
        - How are sounds arranged into syllables?
  - What is the mechanism that groups sounds into syllables?
    - To answer this question, we will need to learn a bit about the structure of syllables and the phonotactics of English
  - The Structure of Syllables
    - Every syllable is made up of (at most) three basic parts:
      - Onset: the consonant(s) at the front of the syllable
      - Nucleus: the sound (typically, a vowel) in the middle of the syllable
      - Coda: The consonant(s) at the end of the vowel
    - Not all of these parts are present in all syllables
      - Some syllables have no onset, e.g. `[it]`
      - Some syllables have no coda, e.g. `[ti]`
      - However, every syllable does have a nucleus
    - Examples:
      - `[bæn]`
        - Onset: `[b]`
        - Nucleus: `[æ]`
        - Coda: `[n]`
      - `[bi]`
        - Onset: `[b]`
        - Nucleus: `[i]`
        - Coda: None
      - `[ɛɡ]`
        - Onset: None
        - Nucleus: `[ɛ]`
        - Coda: `[g]`
      - `[stænd]`
        - Onset: `[st]`
        - Nucleus: `[æ]`
        - Coda: `[nd]`
      - `[b ͡ɔȷ]`
        - Onset: `[b]`
        - Nucleus: [` ͡ɔȷ]`
        - Coda: None
      - `[spɹ ͡eȷ]`
        - Onset: `[spɹ]`
        - Nucleus: `[ ͡eȷ]`
        - Coda: None
      - `[ ͡aȷ]`
        - Onset: None
        - Nucleus: `[ ͡aȷ]`
        - Coda: None
    - Rhymes
      - The nucleus and coda group together to the exclusion of the onset because syllables that have the same nucleus and coda stand in a special relationship to each other: they rhyme
      - Words that don't have a coda may still rhyme
  - Syllabification Trees
    - `σ`: syllable
    - `R`: rhyme
    - `O`: onset
    - `C`: coda
    - `N`: nucleus
  - Building Syllables
    - How do we decide which sounds become onsets, nuclei, and codas?
      - To answer this question, we need to learn a bit about phonotactic constraints
- Phonotactics
  - The rules that determine possible onsets and codas are called phonotactic constraints
  - The Most Complex Onsets
    - `[s]`
      - Followed by the voiceless stops: `[p]`, `[t]`, and `[k]`
        - Each of these are followed by approximants
    - When thinking about constraints, we think about them in terms of groupings
  - Phonotactics and Syllabification
    - Phonotactic constraints guide how a word is syllabified
      - `[nd]` is not a possible onset in English
    - How to tell whether a sequence of sounds is a possible onset or coda?
      - A string is a legal onset if it can begin a word
      - A string is a legal coda if it can end a word
  - The Syllabification Algorithm
    - All vowels become nuclei (diphthong => one nucleus)
    - For each nucleus, find the largest continuous sequence immediately preceding the nucleus and allowed by the language's phonotactics to be an onset, make it an onset
    - For each nucleus, find the largest continuous sequence:
      - Immediately following the nucleus
      - Not part of an onset
      - Allowed by the language's phonotactics to be a coda, make it a coda
    - For each nucleus, make a rhyme out of the nucleus and, if there is one, the immediately following coda
    - For each rhyme, make a syllable out of the rhyme, and, it there is one, the immediately preceding onset
  - Syllabification: Beyond Phonotactics
    - Observation: there is more to syllabification than just phonotactics
    - Example:
      - `[bʌ.l ͡ow.ni]` vs. `*[bʌl. ͡own.i]`
    - Question: both syllabifications respect the phonotactic constraints of English, yet only the one on the left is correct, why?
      - Onsets Before Codas
        - The answers to this question comes from the syllabification algorithm itself:
          - The algorithm determines onsets before codas
          - Therefore, if a sound or combination of sounds could in principle be either an onset or a coda, it will be an onset
        - Only sounds that cannot become onsets become codas
  - Syllabic Consonants
    - In some cases, the sounds `[l]`, `[n]`, `[m]`, and `[ɹ]` can be nuclei in English
    - A more complicated syllabification algorithm is necessary for these cases, which we will not develop in this class
  - Constraints on Syllable Shapes
    - English allows a fair number of possible syllable shapes because it allows onsets and codas to consist of multiple consonants
    - Possible Syllable Shapes
      - `V`: `[ʌ]`
      - `VCCC`: `[æskt]`
      - `CCCV`: `[spɹi]`
      - `CCCVCCC`: `[stɹɛŋθs]`
    - Some languages have stronger constraints on possible syllable shapes:
      - Hawaiian: `CV`, `V`
      - Indonesian: `CV`, `V`, `VC`, `CVC`
      - Hebrew: `CV`, `CCV`, `CCVC`, `CVC`, `CVCC`



## Lecture 4: Tone and Plurals

- Phonotactics
  - Borrowing
    - If a language borrows a word from another language that violates a phonotactic constraint of that language, this word will be modified to avoid this violation
  - Summary
    - Sounds are grouped into syllables, which have internal structure: onset, nucleus, coda, and rhyme
    - There is a deterministic algorithm that assigns syllable structure to strings of sounds
    - Phonotactic constraints play a key role
    - The syllabification algorithm seems to be universal
    - Different languages allow different syllable shapes because they differ in their phonotactics
- Tone
  - Suprasegmentals
    - In addition to individual sounds (segments), languages also have phonetic features that hold at the level of syllables
    - These are called suprasegmentals
  - In many languages, there are words that differ only in their pitch contour
    - These are called tonal languages (i.e., Mandarin)
    - This is not a property of individual sounds, but rather a property of syllables as a while
  - Preview: Stress
    - Another kind of suprasegmental is stress, where some syllables are typically more prominent than others
      - "banana" vs. "Canada"
    - Grammatical rules can be sensitive to stress (and other suprasegmentals)
      - Ex: -freaking- infixation
    - We will talk more about stress in a week or so
- Plurals
  - Refresher
    - We have seen 2 interconnected parts of language
      - A finite set of idiosyncratic, memorized basic elements (words, sounds, etc.)
      - Rules manipulating these elements (syllabification)
    - Heuristic for analysis: everything predictable is handled by a rule
  - A New Type of Rule
    - We are going to look at a second type of rule
    - These rules are used when a phonotactic constraint is violated within a language
    - These rules then change a sound so that the result satisfies the phonotactic constraint
  - The English Plural
    - `[z]` vs. `[s]` vs. `[ɨz]`
      - `[z]`: follows vowels and voiced consonant
      - `[s]`: follows a voiceless consonant
      - `[ɨz]`: follows alveolar/postalveolar fricatives
    - Productivity
      - The Wug Test
      - The form of the plural is not just memorized
      - Therefore, there must be a rule that picks out the right form
    - Complementary Distribution
      - When two elements occur in mutually exclusive environments, they are in complementary distribution
      - English plural: `[z]` and `[s]`
        - One occurs in precisely those environments where the other never occurs
        - In other words, it is possible to predict from the preceding sound whether `[z]` or `[s]` will occur as the plural element
        - These are in complementary distribution
  - A Constraint on English Codas
    - A voiceless sound may not be immediately followed by a voiced sound within the same coda



## Lecture 5: Plurals, Phonemes, and Allophones

- Plurals

  - Generalization:

    - `[z]`: after vowels and voiced consonants
    - `[s]`: after voiceless consonants

  - Constraint:

    - A voiceless sound may not be immediately followed by a voiced sound within the same coda

    - `*[-voice][+voice]`

  - The General Picture

    - The plural element has a single underlying form
    - This form sometimes gives rise to violations of a phonotactic constraint
    - A rule is applied to change a sound so that the constraint is no longer violated

  - The English Plural System, Part 1

    - Underlying form: `/z/`
      - Why not `/s/`?
        - Question:
          - Why did we pick `/z/` as the underlying form?
          - Could we instead have picked `/s/` and postulated a rule that changes it to `[z]`?
        - Answer: no
        - Reason:
          - We assume that rules that change sounds apply only if a phonotactic constraint would be violated otherwise
          - The plural element is `[z]` in many cases in which `[s]` would not violate a phonotactic constraint
    - Phonotactic constraint: `*[-voice][+voice]` in coda
    - Rule: `/z/` becomes `[s]` if preceded by a `[-voice]` consonant in the same coda
      - Underlying form turns into something in an environment

  - Notation

    - By assumption, the underlying form is what a speaker has memorized, and in some cases this form is changed by a phonological rule
    - It is useful to have a way of distinguishing between a word's representation in the speaker's memory and how it's actually pronounced
      - Actual spoken sounds are enclosed between square brackets: `[]`
      - Underlying forms are represented between slashes `//`

  - Where Does `[ɨz]` Occur?

    - After `[s]`, `[z]`, `[ʃ]`, and `[ʒ]`
      - `*[+fricative][-dental][-labiodental][-glottal]`
        - Side note: `[-glottal]` is not necessary here since `[h]` never occurs in a coda position in English
    - `[z]` and `[s]` only occur after sounds other than `[s]`, `[z]`, `[ʃ]`, and `[ʒ]`
      - Complementary distribution => predictable
    - A Second Coda Constraint
      - A non-dental, non-labiodental, and non-glottal fricative may not be immediately followed by another non-dental, non-labiodental, non-glottal fricative within the same coda

  -  The English Plural System, Part 2

    - Underlying form: `/z/`
    - Phonotactic constraint: `*[+fricative][-dental][-labiodental][-glottal]` in coda
    - Rule: `/z/` becomes `[ɨz]` if it is immediately preceded by a `[+fricative][-dental][-labiodental][-glottal]` consonant in the same coda

- Phonemes and Allophones

  - The Big Picture
    - New observation: sometimes the distribution of certain sounds within a language is entirely predictable
      - Given two sounds `A` and `B`, we can predict at any given point whether it is `A` or `B` that will appear
      - These two sounds are in complementary distribution throughout the entire language
    - We will capture this observation in the same way that we did for the English plural
      - One of the sounds is underlying (say `A`)
      - In some environments, this sound violates a phonotactic constraint
      - A rule applies that changes `A` to `B` in these environments
  - English Aspiration
    - English speakers know where aspiration goes in words that they have never heard before
      - This shows that the distribution of aspirated and unaspirated sounds is conditioned by a rule
    - Generalization: `[t^h]`, `[k^h]`, and `[p^h]` occur as the first sound of a syllable
      - Predictable!
      - `[t]` and `[t^h]` are in complementary distribution
      - `[p]` and `[p^h]` are in complementary distribution
      - `[k]` and `[k^h]` are in complementary distribution
    - Phonotactic constraints
      - Constraints on English onsets:
        - `[t]` cannot be the first sound of an onset
        - `[p]` cannot be the first sound of an onset
        - `[k]` cannot be the first sound of an onset
      - Note:
        - These are three separate constraints but clearly look very similar to each other
        - We will combine them into a single constraint later on
    - Rule:
      - Just as in the case of the plural, a rule applies to avoid violating a phonotactic constraint
      - Underlying sounds: `/t/`, `/k/`, `/p/`
      - Rules:
        - Change `/t/` to `[t^h]` when it is the first sound of an onset
        - Change `/p/` to `[p^h]` when it is the first sound of an onset
        - Change `/k/` to `[k^h]` when it is the first sound of an onset
      - Application:
        - `/tap/` => `[t^hap]`
        - `/kap` =? `[k^hap]`
    - Reminder about notation
      - We distinguish between a sound's representation in the speaker's memory and how it's actually pronounced
      - Surface form: actual spoken sounds are enclosed between square brackets (`[]`)
      - Underlying form: the sounds in memory are represented between slashes (`//`)
    - Principle of Simplicity
      - If something already follows from a general rule, speakers do not memorize it
      - Since the aspiration rule already predicts where aspiration goes, speakers do not put that information into memory
      - Therefore, only unaspirated sounds are ever memorized
    - A remaining complication
      - While our analysis works, we have three separate constraints and three separate rules that look very similar to each other
    - Articulatory features
      - We can improve on our analysis
      - The three constraints and three rules can be collapsed into a single constraint and a single rule if we make use of articulatory features
      - Feature-based constraint formulation:
        - `[-voice, -glottal, +stop, -aspirated]` cannot be the first sound of an onset
      - Feature-based rule formation:
        - Change `/-voice, -glottal, +stop, -aspirated/` to `[+aspirated]` if it is the first sound in a syllable
  - Terminology: Phonemes and Allophones
    - A phoneme is a sound (phone) as it is stored in memory (`//`)
    - An allophone is a sound (phone) as it is pronounced (`[]`)
    - Examples:
      - `[X]` is an allophone of a phoneme `/Y/` if `[X]` is one way that speakers pronounce `/Y/`
      - `[t]` and `[t^h]` are allophones of the phoneme `/t/` in English
  - Aspiration Analysis vs. Plural Analysis
    - There are two central differences between our analysis of English aspiration and our analysis of English plurals:
      - With aspiration, the phonotactic conflict does not arise from combining elements
        - Rather it is the underlying form of a word itself that violates the constraint
      - Thus, we care making claims about all the words of a language
  - Allophones of Different Phonemes
    - Reminder: phonotactic constraints differ from language to language
    - Prediction: if rules are triggered by phonotactic constraints, then rules should differ between languages too
    - Whether or not two sounds are allophones of the same phoneme or different phonemes depends on the language
      - If they are not, it becomes impossible to predict which sound will occur based on the environment => no rule
  - Minimal Pairs
    - A minimal pair is a pair of words that differ in exactly one sound
    - A minimal pair for `[X]` and `[Y]` is a minimum pair where one word contains `[X]` and the other contains `[Y]`
    - Examples:
      - `[miɹ]` and `[niɹ]`
      - `[sɪp]` and `[ʃɪp]`
      - `[sejf]` and `[sejv]`
    - If a language contains a minimal pair for `[X]` and `[Y]`, then:
      - It is not possible to predict whether `[X]` or `[Y]` will occur based on the environment
      - `[X]` and `[Y]` are not in complementary distribution
      - `[X]` and `[Y]` are allophones of different phonemes



## Lecture 6: Stress

- Introduction
  - As we have already seen, some phonological properties pertain to syllables rather than segments (i.e., sounds)
  - Such properties are called suprasegmentals
  - Tone and stress are two suprasegmental properties
- Stress
  - Some syllables are more prominent than others:
    - `[bə.næ.nə]` ‘banana’ => `[bə.ˈnæ.nə]`
    - `[kæ.nə.də]` ‘Canada’ => `[ˈkæ.nə.də]`
  - We call prominent syllables stressed
  - Stress is indicated in the IPA with a `[ˈ]` before the syllable
  - Primary and Secondary Stress
    - Longer words have more than one stressed syllable
      - `[tɛ.lə.ɡɹæ.fɪk]` ‘telegraphic’ => `[ˌtɛ.lə.ˈɡɹæ.fɪk]`
    - Typically each word has one syllable with primary stress `[ˈ]` and may have other syllables with secondary stress `[ˌ]`
  - Examples
    - `[mɪ.nə.sow͡ .tə]` 'Minnesota' => `[ˌmɪ.nə.ˈsow͡ .tə]`
    - `[mæ.sə.tʃu.sɪts]` 'Massachusetts' => `[ˌmæ.sə.ˈtʃu.sɪts]`
    - `[θəɹ.mɑ.mɪ.ɾiɹ̵]` 'thermometer' => `[θəɹ.ˈmɑ.mɪ.ɾiɹ̵]`
    - `[mæ.nə.fə.ste͡ȷ.ʃən]` 'manifestation' => `[ˌmæ.nə.fə.ˈste͡ȷ.ʃən]`
- Stress-Conditioned Allophony
  - We have seen that grammatical rules can be sensitive to stress:
    - Ex) -Freaking- Infixation
  - In some cases, allophony is dependent on stress too
  - Vowel Reduction
    - Examples:
      - `[ˈtɛ.lə.ˌɡɹæf]` ‘telegraph’
      - `[tə.ˈlɛ.ɡɹə.ˌfi]` ‘telegraphy’
      - `[ˌtɛ.lə.ˈɡɹæ.fɪk]` ‘telegraphic’
    - Vowels in unstressed syllables are often realized as schwa (`[ə]`), or `[ɨ]`
    - Rule: change any vowel to `[ə]` in an unstressed syllable
      - `/+vowel -stress/ -> [-low -high -back -front]`



## Lecture 7: Flapping and Rule Interactions

- Stress-Conditioned Allophony
  - Vowel Reduction
    - Constraints: `*[+high -stress] *[+back -stress] *[+low -stress]`...
      - Too long and convoluted
    - New constraint: `*[+long -stress]`
      - `+long` related to the acoustics of the sound
  - Flapping
    - In some cases, `[d]` or `[t]` will become a `[ɾ]` in casual speech
    - First stab: `[t]` and `[d]` are changed to `[ɾ]` between vowels
    - The Role of Stress
      - `[ə.ˈt^hɑ.mɪk]` => `[ˈæ.ɾəm]`
      - `[ˌkhəm.p^hju.ˈt^he͡ȷ.ʃən]` => `[k^həm.ˈp^hju.ɾəɹ]`
      - `[ə.ˈdɪ.ʃən]` => `[ˈɛ.ɾɪt]`
    - Flapping Rule
      - Change `[d]` and `[t]` to `[ɾ]` if it is preceded and followed by a vowel AND the `[d]` or `[t]` occurs in an unstressed syllable
      - In features: change `[alveolar, plosive]` to `[voiced, flap]` if it is preceded and followed by a vowel AND the `[alveolar, plosive]` occurs in an unstressed syllable
      - Flapping in English: `/+alveolar +stop -stress/ => [+voiced +flap] / v_v`
- Rule Interactions
  - Review
    - In some cases, the underlying form of a word violates a phonotactic constraint
    - In these cases, a rule is applied that changes the offending sound
    - The resulting representation no longer violates the phonotactic constraint
  - In some cases, more than one rule applies to a word
  - We care going to take a look at possible interactions between the rules that can arise in such cases
  - Scenario 1: Unrelated Rules
    - Rule 1 (Aspiration)
      - Change `/-aspirated -voice +plosive/` to `[+aspirated]` if it occurs at the beginning of an onset
    - Rule 2 (Devoicing)
      -  Change `/z/` to `[s]` if it follows a `[-voice]` sound in the same coda
      - Example:
        - `/tɪpz/` => `[t^hɪps]`
        - The order that we apply the unrelated rules doesn't matter, they don't interact
  - In other cases, rules must be applied in a specific order
  - English Devoiced `[ɹ]`
    - Generalization: devoiced `[ɹ]` occurs after aspirated sounds, while `[ɹ]` occurs anywhere else
    - Underlying form: `/ɹ/`
    - Phonotactic constraint: `*[+aspirated][ɹ]`
    - Rule: change `/ɹ/` to devoiced `[ɹ]` if it follows an aspirated sound
  - Scenario 2: Related Rules
    - `/pɹawd/` => `[p^hɹaed]`
    - Order 1:
      - Aspiration: `[p^hrawd]`
      - `[ɹ]`-devoicing: `[p^hrawd]`
    - Order 2:
      - `[ɹ]`-devoicing: doesn't apply
      - Aspiration: `[p^hrawd]`
    - Only Order 1 produces the right sound
      - This is because `[ɹ]`-devoicing only applies in the context of an aspirated sound
  - Feeding
    - Aspiration creates the environment for `[ɹ]`-devoicing
    - This interaction between rules is called feeding
    - Aspiration feeds `[ɹ]`-devoicing
    - Rule `A` feeds Rule `B` when `A` creates a context for `B` and `B` wouldn't apply otherwise
  - Bleeding
    - Another type of interaction is called bleeding
    - We will look at 2 rules in Canadian English that illustrate bleeding
  - Scenario 3: Bleeding
    - Rule 1: Flapping
    - Rule 2: Raising
      - In Canadian English, the diphthongs `[aj]` and `[ʌj]` are in complementary distribution
      - The diphthongs `[aw]` and `[ʌw]` are also in complementary distribution
      - Generalization: `[ʌj]` and `[ʌw]` appear before voiceless consonants, `[aj]` and `[aw]` appear everywhere else
      - Underlying form: `/aj/` and `/aw/`
      - Phonotactic constraint: `*[+diphthong +low +back +tense][-voice]`
      - Rule: change `/+diphthong +low +back +tense/` to `[-low]` before `[-voice]`
    - Rule Ordering
      - `/ɹajtɨɹ/`
      - Order 1:
        - Raising: `[ɹʌjtɨɹ]`
        - Flapping: `[ɹʌjɾɨɹ]`
      - Order 2:
        - Flapping: `[ɹajɾɨɹ]`
        - Raising: doesn't apply
      - Only Order 2 produces the right result
    - The relationship between the 2 rules
      - No raising rakes place because the flap is voiced and hence there is no need to raise
      - Flapping destroys the context in which raising rakes place
        - Flapping bleeds raising
    - Rule `A` bleeds Rule `B` when `A` creates a context in which `B` can no longer apply
  - Summary
    - No interaction: the rules have nothing to do with each other; they are completely independent
    - Feeding: Rule `A` creates the context for Rule `B`
      - Rule `A` applies first, followed by Rule `B`
    - Bleeding:
      - Rule `A` destroys the context for Rule `B`
        - Rule `A` applies first and prevents Rule `B` from taking place



## Lecture 8: Morphology

- Morphology
  - Phonetics: how are sounds produced?
  - Phonology: what are the rules affecting how a word is pronounced
  - Morphology: what are the rules for forming words
- Examples:
  - English plural
  - -(a)licious
- What is a Word?
  - While easy to intuit, it is difficult to formally define the notion of "word"
  - Hypothesis #1: Orthography (Spelling)
    - A word is a linguistic unit separated from other words in writing by spaces
    - Not all languages have standardized written traditions
    - Not all languages write with spaces between the words
    - Even in languages with rich written tradition, like English, orthography is porr guide for what a word is
  - Hypothesis #2: Internal Integrity and Cohesion
    - A word is a linguistic unit that cannot be "split apart"
    - This hypothesis makes the right distinction in some places
      - Ex) blue book vs. clueless
    - However, this rules out thinks that we would probably want to consider words
      - Ex) Cali-freaking-fornia
  - Hypothesis #3: Phonology
    - A word is a linguistic unit that is prosodically demarcated (i.e., separated by pauses) and serves as the domain for stress assignment
    - This hypothesis makes the right distinction in some places
      - Ex) black bird vs. blackbird
    - However, typical speech doesn't really have pauses in it
    - Also, sometimes the domain of stress assignment seems like more than one word
      - Ex) contractions
- Morphemes
  - Every definition of "word" overgenerates or undergenerates to some degree
  - Even though there is not a clear definition of "word", there is a meaningful linguistic unit that we can use to study morphology: morphemes
  - A morpheme is the smallest unit of indivisible sound and meaning in a given language
- The Mental Lexicon
  - The mental lexicon stores idiosyncratic information about morphemes in memory
  - For each morpheme, a speaker has memorized:
    - Phonemic representation
    - Meaning
    - Part of speech
    - etc.
  - Example: "cat"
    - Phonemic representation: `/kæt/`
    - Part of speech: noun
    - Meaning: animal
- Forming Complex Words
  - As we have seen, it is possible to combine meaningful parts into complex words
  - In many cases, these meaningful parts cannot stand on their own
  - Example: `[əbl]`
    - Speakers can add `[əbl]` to new words
    - Consequence: speakers do not just have all the words with `[əbl]` memorized
      - Rather, there seems to be a rule that adds `[əbl]`
    - The meaning of words that contain `[əbl]` is very systematic
      - Meaning of `X-[əbl]`: "can be `X`-ed"
  - Languages have productive rules for combining meaningful parts to form complex morphological expressions
    - Terminology
      - A free morpheme can stand on its own, i.e., as a free "word"
      - A bound morpheme cannot stand on its own
      - An affix is a bound morpheme that attaches to a stem
      - A stem is a unit to which affixes can be attached
      - A root is a stem that cannot be analyzed any further into constituent morphemes
- Roots and Stems
  - All roots are stems, but not all stems are roots
- Towards the `[əbl]`-rule
  - `[əbl]` attaches to the end of stems
    - We will see shortly that such affixes are called suffixes
    - `[əbl]` can attach to the end of verbs
      - When it does so, it forms an adjective
    - But `[əbl]` doesn't attach to adjectives or nouns
  - Summary: Properties of the `[əbl]`-rule
    - It only combines with verbs, not nouns or adjectives
    - It attaches to the right of the verb
    - The result of attaching `[əbl]` is an adjective
    - `Verb + /əbl/ = Adjective`
- Types of Affixes
  - A prefix attaches to the front of the stem
  - A suffix attaches to the end of the stem



## Lecture 9: Morphological Processes

- Ambiguity
  - If a sequence of sounds, morphemes, or words have more than one meaning, we say that his sequence is ambiguous
    - Two types of ambiguity:
      - Lexical ambiguity: two morphemes happen to sound the same
      - Structural ambiguity: arrangements of elements differs
  - Morphological ambiguity
    - Observation: some words can be formed in more than one way, giving rise to different meanings
    - A kind of structural ambiguity
    - Ex) "unlockable"
- Infixation
  - An infix attaches inside the stem
- Circumfixes
  - A circumfix attaches to both the front and end of the stem
  - Circumfixes are typologically rare
- Summary: Types of Affixes
  - Prefix: attaches to the front of the stem
  - Suffix: attaches to the end of the stem
  - Infix: attaches inside the stem
  - CIrcumfix: attached around the stem
  - Note: affixes are fixed strings of sounds
- (Full) Reduplication
  - Indonesian plural rule: double the entire stem to form the plural
- (Partial) Reduplication
  - Ilokano plural rule: double the first CVC sequence to form the plural to make a plural
- Reduplication vs. Affixation
  - Reduplication is not an affix
    - Affixes involve the addition of a fixed string of sounds
    - This is not the case with reduplication, rather the sounds come from the stem itself
- Compounding
  - A compound consists of two or more elements that can also occur on their own
  - Iterated compounding
    - It is possible to take a compound and combine it with another free morpheme, creating a larger compound
    - In this way, compounds can get very large
  - A regularity of compounding
    - `N + N = N`
    - `N + V = V`
    - `A + V = V`
    - `A + N = N`
    - `V + N = N`
    - `A + A = A`
    - A generalization: the category of the compound is always the same as the category of the last morpheme in the compound
    - The Right-Hand Head Rule
      - If `X` is the head of `Y`, then the grammatical category (= part of speech) of `Y` is the same as that of `X`
      - In an English compound, the head is the right-most morpheme
- Rethinking English Affixes
  - Prefixes never change the category
  - Suffixes can change the category
- A more general Right-Hand Head Rule
  - In English, the head of a morphologically complex expression is the right-most morpheme
  - Consequence: affixes have a category, just like free morphemes
  - The Right-Hand Head Rule not only applies to compounding but also to affixation
  - What about prefixes? What is the category of prefixes?
    - This is because the category of a complex morphological expression is always determined by its right-most element

- Summary
  - Languages have productive rules to create morphologically complex expressions
  - Morphological processes: affixation, reduplication, compounding
  - Right-Hand Head Rule: in English, the head of a morphologically complex expression is the right-most morpheme



## Lecture 10: Syntax

- The Big Question
  - What do you know when you know a human language?
    - A finite set of idiosyncratic, memorized basic elements
      - Phonemes, morphemes, features, etc.
    - Rules for combining and manipulating these elements
      - Phonological rules, syllabification, morphological rules, etc.
- Overview
  - Phonetics: how are sounds articulated?
  - Phonology: how are sounds organized and manipulated?
  - Morphology: how are words built up from morphemes?
  - Syntax: how are sentences formed from words?
- Syntax
  - Syntax studies the rules of sentence formation
  - Core Properties:
    - Creativity
      - Syntactic rules of language allow for a wide range of creative options
      - Most sentences are completely new
      - Speakers can understand and produce sentences that they have never encountered before
      - Not every string of words in a language is a sentence of that language
        - Implication: there are rules about these combinations
    - Category dependence
      - Syntactic Categories
        - Words belong to classes, called grammatical categories (or parts of speech)
        - Syntactic rules only care about these grammatical categories, not individual words
          - This is category depedence
      - N(ouns)
        - Ex) dog, cat, etc.
        - Rule-of-thumb test: can occur as `X` in "I heard about the `X`"
        - In addition, we will assume that proper names and pronouns are also nouns
      - V(erbs)
        - Ex) walk, talk, etc.
        - Rule-of-thumb test: can have "can" appear directly before them
      - A(djectives)
        - Ex) big, bad, etc.
        - Rule-of-thmb test: cam appear between "the very" and an `N`
      - D(eterminers) + P(repositions)
        - Determiners: the, that, a, etc.
        - Prepositions: to, from, on, after, etc.
    - Recursion
      - Sentences are unbounded (there's no upper limit to a sentence's length)
      - A sentence can itself contain another sentence
        - This is called recursion
      - Because of this property, sentences can be unboundedly long
        - There is no longest sentence of English
        - There is an infinite number of English sentences
      - In general terms:
        - Recursion (informal definition): something contains a version of itself
        - Consequence: syntactic rules must be recursive
          - In other words, it must be possible for syntactic rules to apply to their own output
  - We will develop phrase-structure rules to capture these properties
- Phrase-Structure Rules
  - Our first phrase-structure rule
    - Observation: you can form a sentence in English by combining a noun and a verb
    - Rule: `S -> NV`
  - Noun Phrases
    - The subject can be more complex than just a single word
      - We call this unit a noun phrase (`NP`)
    - New rules:
      - `S -> NP V`
      - `NP -> (D) (A) N (P NP)`
        - Units in `()` are optional
  - Verb Phrases
    - A subject `NP` can combine with more than just a word
      - We call this unit a verb phrase (`VP`)
    - New rules:
      - `S -> NP VP`
      - `VP -> V (NP)`
  - Prepositional Phrases
    - In English, prepositions are usually followed by an `NP`
      - We call the unit that consists of the preposition and the `NP` that follows it a prepositional phrase (`PP`)
    - Rules for `PP`s
      - `PP -> P NP`
      - `NP -> (D) (A) N (PP)`
      - `VP -> V (NP) (PP)`
