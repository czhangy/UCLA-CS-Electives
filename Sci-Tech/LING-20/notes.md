- Introduction
  - What is Linguistics?
    - The study of human language
    - Our ability to learn and use a human language constitutes a profound biological mystery
  - Why Study Human Language?
    - The complexity of human language is obscured by how effortless it is:
      - When you see an object, your brain automatically transforms the light waves that hit your retina into the colors, shapes, etc. that you perceive, without any conscious effort on your part and you being aware of these computations
      - When you hear a sentence of a language that you speak, you immediately and effortlessly understand it, largely without conscious effort and awareness of the computation
        - This doesn't mean there isn't a lot going on to our use of language
  - An Example
    - "The pink elephant in my pajamas is dancing on the grass"
    - Puts a thought into our heads, simply by making sounds and/or putting shapes on the screen
    - As speakers of English, we automatically convert these sounds/shapes into meaning
  - Key Question
    - What knowledge do speakers of a language have that allows them to do this?
  - Aspects of This Knowledge
    - It is abstract and unconscious
      - Converting sounds into meaning "happens" automatically in your head, you have no conscious thought of the process
    - It is rapid and automatic
      - When you hear an English sentence, you can't help but understand it virtually immediately
  - Abstractness of Grammatical Knowledge
    - Speakers typically have very specific intuitions that can differ clearly between very similar linguistic structures
      - "Mary is easy to please."
        - Mary is the one who is pleased
      - "Mary is eager to please."
        - Mary is doing the pleasing
      - "Deborah expected to surprise her."
        - "her" != Deborah
      - "Who did Deborah expect to surprise her?"
        - "her" ?= Deborah
  - Key Question
    - What is the unconscious knowledge that speakers of a language have that allows them to do this?
    - A wrong answer: a speaker of a language has simply memorized all the sentences of that language and what they mean
      - Cannot be the case because you can understand sentences you haven't heard before (~70% of the sentences you hear)
  - The Role of Rules
    - There is an infinite number of English sentences that you can understand, even if you have ever heard them before
    - Not just every string of English words is a sentence of English (ungrammatical)
    - It is not just the combination of words into sentences that is governed by rules, the same is true for the combination of sounds
  - Upshot
    - Even if you have never heard a sequence of words before, you know whether it is a sentence of English or not
    - When you know a language, you know
      - A list of basic expressions (words, sounds, etc.)
      - A combinatory system of rules that allow you to put them together
  - Language as it is, not as it "should be"
    - As scientists, linguists are interested in the real world
      - As such, they are interested in the rules that speakers of a language actually do follow
      - They aren't interested in the rules that some people think speakers should follow
    - Stranding prepositions, splitting infinitives, passive voice, double negatives, etc.
    - A linguist treats all varieties of all languages as equally valuable
    - A linguist will never tell a native speaker of a language that they should or shouldn't talk in a particular way
  - Conclusion
    - What you know when you know a human language
      - A memorized set of basic expressions
      - A set of rules for combining these basic expressions
    - Linguists are interested in discovering these rules
    - Big question: what is the system of rules and expressions that underlies our ability to speak and understand a human language?
