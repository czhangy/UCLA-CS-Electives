## Lecture 1: Introduction and Anatomy

- Introduction
  - What is Linguistics?
    - The study of human language
    - Our ability to learn and use a human language constitutes a profound biological mystery
  - Why Study Human Language?
    - The complexity of human language is obscured by how effortless it is:
      - When you see an object, your brain automatically transforms the light waves that hit your retina into the colors, shapes, etc. that you perceive, without any conscious effort on your part and you being aware of these computations
      - When you hear a sentence of a language that you speak, you immediately and effortlessly understand it, largely without conscious effort and awareness of the computation
        - This doesn't mean there isn't a lot going on to our use of language
  - An Example
    - "The pink elephant in my pajamas is dancing on the grass"
    - Puts a thought into our heads, simply by making sounds and/or putting shapes on the screen
    - As speakers of English, we automatically convert these sounds/shapes into meaning
  - Key Question
    - What knowledge do speakers of a language have that allows them to do this?
  - Aspects of This Knowledge
    - It is abstract and unconscious
      - Converting sounds into meaning "happens" automatically in your head, you have no conscious thought of the process
    - It is rapid and automatic
      - When you hear an English sentence, you can't help but understand it virtually immediately
  - Abstractness of Grammatical Knowledge
    - Speakers typically have very specific intuitions that can differ clearly between very similar linguistic structures
      - "Mary is easy to please."
        - Mary is the one who is pleased
      - "Mary is eager to please."
        - Mary is doing the pleasing
      - "Deborah expected to surprise her."
        - "her" != Deborah
      - "Who did Deborah expect to surprise her?"
        - "her" ?= Deborah
  - Key Question
    - What is the unconscious knowledge that speakers of a language have that allows them to do this?
    - A wrong answer: a speaker of a language has simply memorized all the sentences of that language and what they mean
      - Cannot be the case because you can understand sentences you haven't heard before (~70% of the sentences you hear)
  - The Role of Rules
    - There is an infinite number of English sentences that you can understand, even if you have ever heard them before
    - Not just every string of English words is a sentence of English (ungrammatical)
    - It is not just the combination of words into sentences that is governed by rules, the same is true for the combination of sounds
  - Upshot
    - Even if you have never heard a sequence of words before, you know whether it is a sentence of English or not
    - When you know a language, you know
      - A list of basic expressions (words, sounds, etc.)
      - A combinatory system of rules that allow you to put them together
  - Language as it is, not as it "should be"
    - As scientists, linguists are interested in the real world
      - As such, they are interested in the rules that speakers of a language actually do follow
      - They aren't interested in the rules that some people think speakers should follow
    - Stranding prepositions, splitting infinitives, passive voice, double negatives, etc.
    - A linguist treats all varieties of all languages as equally valuable
    - A linguist will never tell a native speaker of a language that they should or shouldn't talk in a particular way
  - Conclusion
    - What you know when you know a human language
      - A memorized set of basic expressions
      - A set of rules for combining these basic expressions
    - Linguists are interested in discovering these rules
    - Big question: what is the system of rules and expressions that underlies our ability to speak and understand a human language?
- Vocal-Tract Anatomy
  - The Tongue
    - Tip of the tongue
    - Blade (or front) of the tongue
    - Body (or back) of the tongue
  - The Larynx
    - In the middle of your throat is the larynx
    - Inside your larynx are muscles called the vocal folds
    - The opening between the vocal folds is the glottis
      - The vocal folds have the ability to open and close the glottis
        - When the glottis is closed, air can't leave the lungs
        - When the glottis is open, air freely leaves the lungs
      - When the vocal folds come so close together that they are almost closed, they vibrate
        - This vibration is your voice
  - The Velum
    - The soft area at the very back of your mouth is your velum
    - It is the doorway to the nasal passage
    - If it is lowered, air can go into the nasal cavity and out the nose
    - If it is raised, air has to go through your mouth
  - The (Hard) Palate
    - The (hard) palate is the hardest area of the roof of your mouth
    - Just in front of the velum
  - The Alveolar Ridge
    - The fleshy ridge just behind your top teeth is the alveolar ridge
  - The Post-Alveolar Region
    - The area between your palate and your alveolar ridge is the post-alveolar (or alveo-palatal) region
    - The area where the roof of your mouth rises sharply
  - The Teeth
    - The teeth are involved in making some speech sounds ("th", "f", etc.)
  - The Lips
    - The lips are involved in making speech sounds ("f", "p", "m", etc.)
  - The Problem with Spelling
    - In order to talk about sounds, we need a way of representing them in written form
    - Why not use English spelling to represent sounds?
      - English spelling is often ambiguous
        - Same sound, different spelling: their, there, they're
        - Same spelling, different sound: read, bow, roof
      - Some sounds don't have a designated symbol: (th)orn, (th)is, si(ng), etc.
    - Other languages have sounds that English lacks and therefore English doesn't have a symbol for; for example:
      - ñ in Spanish
      - ‘ in Hawaiian
      - đ in Vietnamese
      - ch or ö in German
  - International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
    - Developed over 100 years ago by the International Phonetic Association
    - Unambiguous: 1 symbol per sound, 1 sound per symbol
    - Universal: all known human phones represented
    - Many symbols used in the IPA are the same symbols used in our orthography (spelling)
      - These aren't the same thing!
    - If a symbol is from the IPA, it is enclosed in square brackets
    - When speech is represented in the IPA, we say that we are forming a phonetic transcription



## Lecture 2: Consonants and Vowels

- Consonants
  - Main parameters for describing consonants
    - Manner of articulation
      - How the gesture in the vocal tract occurs
      - Stops/Plosives: sounds that create a complete blockade in the oral tract
        - Bilabial stops
          - `[p]`: bilabial, voiceless, oral (<u>p</u>an)
          - `[b]`: bilabial, voiced, oral (<u>b</u>an)
          - `[m]`: bilabial, voiced, nasal (<u>m</u>an)
        - Alveolar stops
          - `[t]`: alveolar, voiceless, oral (<u>t</u>an)
          - `[d]`: alveolar, voiced, oral (<u>D</u>an)
          - `[n]`: alveolar, voiced, nasal (Da<u>n</u>)
          - `[ɾ]`: alveolar, voiced, oral, tap/flap (le<u>tt</u>er)
          - `[r]`: alveolar, voiced, oral, trill (pe<u>rr</u>o)
        - Velar stops
          - `[k]`: velar, voiceless, oral (<u>c</u>an)
          - `[g]`: velar, voiced, oral (<u>G</u>et)
          - `[ŋ]`: velar, voiced, nasal (si<u>ng</u>)
        - Glottal stop
          - `[ʔ]`: glottal, voiceless, oral (<u>u</u>h-<u>o</u>h)
          - Always voiceless
      - Fricatives: produced by creating a radical narrowing in the oral tract
        - Through that radical narrow, a turbulence in the air-flow is created that makes a characteristic "hissing" sound
        - Bilabial fricatives
          - `[ɸ]`: bilabial, voiceless, oral (<u>F</u>uji)
          - `[β]`: bilabial, voiced, oral (de<u>b</u>er)
          - Don't exist in English
        - Labio-dental fricatives
          - `[f]`: labio-dental, voiceless, oral (<u>f</u>an)
          - `[v]`: labio-dental, voiced, oral (<u>v</u>an)
        - Dental fricatives
          - `[θ]`: dental, voiceless, oral (<u>th</u>igh)
          - `[ð]`: dental, voiced, oral (<u>th</u>e)
        - Alveolar fricatives
          - `[s]`: alveolar, voiceless, oral (<u>s</u>ip)
          - `[z]`: alveolar, voiced, oral (<u>z</u>ip)
        - Post-alveolar fricatives
          - `[ʃ]`: post-alveolar, voiceless, oral (mi<u>ss</u>ion)
          - `[ʒ]`: post-alveolar, voiced, oral (vi<u>s</u>ion)
        - Glottal fricative
          - `[h]`: glottal, voiceless, oral (<u>h</u>eap)
      - Affricates: produced as a stop that is released into a fricative
        - Sometimes treated as a single speech sound
        - In this class, treated as the combination of two sounds
        - `[tʃ]`: alveo-palatal, voiceless, oral (<u>ch</u>ump)
        - `[dʒ]`: alveo-palatal, voiced, oral (<u>J</u>ump)
      - Approximants: involve a less radial narrowing in the oral tract than is found with fricatives, but greater than is found with vowels
        - For this reason, often called semi-vowels
        - Labial approximants
          - `[w]`: labio-velar, voiced, oral (<u>w</u>in)
        - Alveolar approximants
          - `[l]`: alveolar, voiced, oral, lateral (<u>l</u>ed)
          - `[ɹ]`: alveolar, voiced, oral (<u>r</u>ed)
        - Palatal approximants
          - `[j]`: palatal, voiced, oral (<u>y</u>es)
    - Place of articulation
      - Where in the vocal tract the gesture occurs
    - Nasality
      - Whether or not the velum is lowered, allowing vibrating air into the nasal cavity
      - Nasal: the velum is lowered so the air flows into the nasal cavity
      - Oral/Non-nasal: the velum is raised so the air doesn't flow into the nasal cavity
      - The nasal sounds of English:
        - `[n]` (ba<u>n</u>)
        - `[m]` (ba<u>m</u>)
        - `[ŋ]` (ba<u>ng</u>)
        - These sounds are all voiced
    - Voicing
      - Whether or not the vocal folds are vibrating while the sound is being made
      - Voiced: vocal folds vibrate while the sound is being made
      - Voiceless: vocal folds don't vibrate while the sound is being made
      - English has many pairs of consanants that only differ in voicing:
        - `[s]` vs. `[z]` (<u>s</u>ip vs. <u>z</u>ip)
        - `[f]` vs. `[v]` (<u>f</u>at vs. <u>v</u>at)
        - `[θ]` vs. `[ð]` (<u>th</u>igh vs. <u>th</u>y)
        - `[ʃ]` vs. `[ʒ]` (mi<u>ss</u>ion vs. vi<u>s</u>ion)
        - `[tʃ]` vs. `[dʒ]` (<u>ch</u>ump vs. <u>J</u>ump)
        - `[p]` vs. `[b]` (<u>p</u>at vs. <u>b</u>at)
        - `[t]` vs. `[d]` (<u>t</u>ip vs. <u>d</u>ip)
        - `[k]` vs. `[g]` (<u>c</u>ap vs. <u>G</u>ap)
- Vowels
  - A vowel is a speech sound that is articulated while the vocal tract is completely open
  - There is no air pressure build-up at any point above the glottis
  - Parameters for describing vowels
    - Tongue position
      - Height: height of the tongue's highest point in the mouth
        - Distance between the tongue and the roof of the mouth
        - h<u>ea</u>t (high) vs. h<u>oo</u>t (low)
      - Backness: how far back in the mouth is the tongue position
        - h<u>ea</u>t (front) vs. h<u>oo</u>t (back)
        - Front vowels
          - `[i]`: high, unrounded, tense (b<u>ee</u>t)
          - `[ɪ]`: high, unrounded, lax (b<u>i</u>t)
          - `[e]`: mid, unrounded, tense (d<u>e</u>ber)
          - `[ɛ]`: mid, unrounded, lax (r<u>e</u>d)
          - `[æ]`: low, unrounded, lax (r<u>a</u>d)
          - `[a]`: low, unrounded, tense (c<u>a</u>r)
        - Central vowels
          - `[ɨ]`: high, unrounded, lax (ros<u>e</u>s)
          - `[ə]`: mid, unrounded, lax (Ros<u>a</u>'s)
        - Back vowels
          - `[u]`: high, rounded, tense (f<u>oo</u>d)
          - `[ʊ]`: high, rounded, lax (p<u>u</u>t)
          - `[o]`: mid, rounded, tense (perr<u>o</u>)
          - `[ɔ]`: mid, rounded, lax (<u>o</u>range)
          - `[ʌ]`: mid, unrounded, lax (c<u>u</u>t)
          - `[ɑ]`: low, unrounded, tense (c<u>o</u>t)
    - Rounding of lips
      - Rounded vs. Unrounded
      - Are the lips rounded while the vowel is produced?
      - h<u>ea</u>t (unrounded) vs. h<u>oo</u>t (rounded)
    - Tenseness
      - Tense
        - Produced with greater muscle tension
        - Usually longer
      - Lax
        - Produced with less muscle tension
        - Usually shorter
  - Diphthongs
    - All the vowels we have seen so far are pure vowels
      - There is no noticeable change in the quality of the vowel over the course of the production
    - A second group of vowels is called diphthongs
      - The vowel ends differently than it starts
      - Diphthongs are basically a combination of two vowels, or a vowel and a glide, with a gradual transition between them
    - Front diphthongs
      - `[ej]`: mid, front, unrounded (b<u>ai</u>t)
      - `[aj]`: low, front, unrounded (<u>i</u>ce)
      - `[aw]`: low, front, rounded (bl<u>ou</u>se)
    - Back diphthongs
      - `[ow]`: mid, back, rounded (b<u>oa</u>t)
      - `[ɔj]`: mid, back, rounded (b<u>oy</u>)
