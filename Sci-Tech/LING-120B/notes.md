## Lecture 1: Intro and Parts of Speech

- What is Syntax?
  - Two notions of syntax:
    - As a system of grammar: the part of language that allows speakers to create and undersatand phrases and sentences
    - As a linguistic discipline: the subfield of linguistics that studies the rules and properties of phrases and sentences of human languages
  - What do we mean by rule?
    - We do not mean prescriptive rules (rules that prescribe how people should speak)
    - We are interested in how people really taken (descriptive rules)
  - The syntax of what?
    - The syntax of human language:
      - All and only humans have language
        - There are no primitive or simple languages
        - Even stigmatized languages and varieties of languages are complex, rule-governed systems
      - Superficially very different languages share deep similarities
      - Many logically possible grammatical structures do not exist in any language
      - Children acquire language similarly across different languages
      - Languages shares properties with innate instinctual behaviors
        - The innateness hypothesis: the ability to use language is part of the human biological makeup
  - What does a theory of syntax have to explain?
    - Creativity: speakers of a language can create and understand new sentences
    - Order sensitivity: the order of words affects:
      - Whether a sentence is possible in a language
      - What a sentence means
    - Ambiguity: a string of words can have multiple meanings
    - Recursion: sentence structures embed inside one another, allowing infinitely many sentence structures
    - Restrictions: not every arrangement of words is a sentence
  - Grammaticality
    - A sentence that is part of a language is called grammatical, a sentence that is not is called ungrammatical
    - Our data = grammaticality judgements
    - Meaningless != ungrammatical
    - Ungrammatical != hard to understand
  - Summary
    - Goals of syntax: discover the rules and processes that:
      - Allow the production and comprehension of infinitely many sentences
      - Capture the relationship between syntactic structure and meaning
      - Capture syntactic ambiguity
      - Characterize ungrammaticality, explain why some expressions with plausible meanings and structures are unacceptable
    - How will we do this?
      - Revisit the issues and phenomena already that we saw in Ling 20, but deeper
      - Flesh out concepts that we only touched briefly before
      - Look at new phenomena
      - Look at a variety of languages
    - Consequence: our understanding of syntactic structure will change as we move along
- Parts of Speech
  - The Traditional/Semantic Approach
    - How do we classify words?
    - The semantic approach: parts of speech are classified by their meanings
      - Noun: person, place, or thing
      - Verb: action, occurrence, or state of being
    - Some words can change its part of speech depending on where it appears
    - How do we know that a particular word belongs to a particular category?
      - We look at their distributions
  - Distributional Criteria
    - Distributional definition: parts of speech are classified by their distribution
      - Morphological distribution: affixes appear only on certain kinds of words
      - Syntactic distribution: position relative to other words
    - Words that have the same or strongly overlapping distributions have the same part of speech
    - Words whose distribution does not overlap have different parts of speech
    - Since distribution is language specific, the criteria for identifying parts of speech and the part of speech categories themselves can be language specific
  - Morphemes
    - Morpheme: meaningful atom = the smallest meaning-bearing unit in language
      - They can be free or bound
      - The can be an affix or a root
      - The can belong to an open or to a closed class
      - There are inflectional and derivational affixes
        - Derivational:
          - Plays a lexical (meaningful) role
          - Can change part of speech/category
          - Never required by grammatical rules
          - Typically indicate semantic relations within the word
          - Typically occur before inflectional morphology
        - Inflectional:
          - Plays only a grammatical role
          - Never changes base's category
          - Usually required by grammatical rules
          - Typically indicate relations between different words in a sentence
          - Occur at the end
    - A word can be atomic (if it contains only one morpheme) or complex (if it contains more than one)
  - Nouns
    - Derivational suffixes: -ment, -ness, -ity
    - Inflectional suffixes: -s, -es, -a
    - Syntactic distribution: nouns can appear:
      - As the only word between determiners and verbs
      - As the only word after determiners, adjectives, verbs, prepositions
      - Negated by no
  - Verbs
    - Derivational suffixes: -ify, -ize
    - Inflectional suffices: -ing, -en, -s
    - Syntactic distribution: verbs can appear:
      - As the first word in a (non-negative) command
      - As negated by not/n't
      - Modified by adverbs, but not adjectives
  - Adjectives
    - Derivational suffixes: -able, -ing, -al
    - Inflectional suffixes: comparative -er, superlative -est
    - Syntactic distribution: adjectives can appear:
      - As the only word between determiners and nouns
      - After comparative more and superlative most
      - Modified by degree adverbs like very
  - Compositionality
    - Morphemes combine in a regular way
    - Claim: only one ordering of the five morphemes in de-nation-al-iz-ation produces an English word
    - According to what we said so far, the speaker must know:
      - How each morpheme is pronounced
      - What kind of morpheme it is (free, prefix, affix, etc.)
      - If an affix, what it combines with (what it c-selects)
      - If an affix, that the c-selected element must be adjacent to the affix
        - Only thing not encoded in the lexical entry, it is not specific to any one lexical entry
      - If an affix, what kind of things result after c-selection
  - Lexical Entries - First Version
    - Lexical entry of a morpheme (= the implicit knowledge that a speaker has about it):
      - -er: c-selects `V` to form `N`
    - C-selection stands for category selection
    - The collection of lexical entries is called the lexicon
