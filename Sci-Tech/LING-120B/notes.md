## Lecture 1: Intro and Parts of Speech

- What is Syntax?
  - Two notions of syntax:
    - As a system of grammar: the part of language that allows speakers to create and undersatand phrases and sentences
    - As a linguistic discipline: the subfield of linguistics that studies the rules and properties of phrases and sentences of human languages
  - What do we mean by rule?
    - We do not mean prescriptive rules (rules that prescribe how people should speak)
    - We are interested in how people really taken (descriptive rules)
  - The syntax of what?
    - The syntax of human language:
      - All and only humans have language
        - There are no primitive or simple languages
        - Even stigmatized languages and varieties of languages are complex, rule-governed systems
      - Superficially very different languages share deep similarities
      - Many logically possible grammatical structures do not exist in any language
      - Children acquire language similarly across different languages
      - Languages shares properties with innate instinctual behaviors
        - The innateness hypothesis: the ability to use language is part of the human biological makeup
  - What does a theory of syntax have to explain?
    - Creativity: speakers of a language can create and understand new sentences
    - Order sensitivity: the order of words affects:
      - Whether a sentence is possible in a language
      - What a sentence means
    - Ambiguity: a string of words can have multiple meanings
    - Recursion: sentence structures embed inside one another, allowing infinitely many sentence structures
    - Restrictions: not every arrangement of words is a sentence
  - Grammaticality
    - A sentence that is part of a language is called grammatical, a sentence that is not is called ungrammatical
    - Our data = grammaticality judgements
    - Meaningless != ungrammatical
    - Ungrammatical != hard to understand
  - Summary
    - Goals of syntax: discover the rules and processes that:
      - Allow the production and comprehension of infinitely many sentences
      - Capture the relationship between syntactic structure and meaning
      - Capture syntactic ambiguity
      - Characterize ungrammaticality, explain why some expressions with plausible meanings and structures are unacceptable
    - How will we do this?
      - Revisit the issues and phenomena already that we saw in Ling 20, but deeper
      - Flesh out concepts that we only touched briefly before
      - Look at new phenomena
      - Look at a variety of languages
    - Consequence: our understanding of syntactic structure will change as we move along
- Parts of Speech
  - The Traditional/Semantic Approach
    - How do we classify words?
    - The semantic approach: parts of speech are classified by their meanings
      - Noun: person, place, or thing
      - Verb: action, occurrence, or state of being
    - Some words can change its part of speech depending on where it appears
    - How do we know that a particular word belongs to a particular category?
      - We look at their distributions
  - Distributional Criteria
    - Distributional definition: parts of speech are classified by their distribution
      - Morphological distribution: affixes appear only on certain kinds of words
      - Syntactic distribution: position relative to other words
    - Words that have the same or strongly overlapping distributions have the same part of speech
    - Words whose distribution does not overlap have different parts of speech
    - Since distribution is language specific, the criteria for identifying parts of speech and the part of speech categories themselves can be language specific
  - Morphemes
    - Morpheme: meaningful atom = the smallest meaning-bearing unit in language
      - They can be free or bound
      - The can be an affix or a root
      - The can belong to an open or to a closed class
      - There are inflectional and derivational affixes
        - Derivational:
          - Plays a lexical (meaningful) role
          - Can change part of speech/category
          - Never required by grammatical rules
          - Typically indicate semantic relations within the word
          - Typically occur before inflectional morphology
        - Inflectional:
          - Plays only a grammatical role
          - Never changes base's category
          - Usually required by grammatical rules
          - Typically indicate relations between different words in a sentence
          - Occur at the end
    - A word can be atomic (if it contains only one morpheme) or complex (if it contains more than one)
  - Nouns
    - Derivational suffixes: -ment, -ness, -ity
    - Inflectional suffixes: -s, -es, -a
    - Syntactic distribution: nouns can appear:
      - As the only word between determiners and verbs
      - As the only word after determiners, adjectives, verbs, prepositions
      - Negated by no
  - Verbs
    - Derivational suffixes: -ify, -ize
    - Inflectional suffices: -ing, -en, -s
    - Syntactic distribution: verbs can appear:
      - As the first word in a (non-negative) command
      - As negated by not/n't
      - Modified by adverbs, but not adjectives
  - Adjectives
    - Derivational suffixes: -able, -ing, -al
    - Inflectional suffixes: comparative -er, superlative -est
    - Syntactic distribution: adjectives can appear:
      - As the only word between determiners and nouns
      - After comparative more and superlative most
      - Modified by degree adverbs like very
  - Compositionality
    - Morphemes combine in a regular way
    - Claim: only one ordering of the five morphemes in de-nation-al-iz-ation produces an English word
    - According to what we said so far, the speaker must know:
      - How each morpheme is pronounced
      - What kind of morpheme it is (free, prefix, affix, etc.)
      - If an affix, what it combines with (what it c-selects)
      - If an affix, that the c-selected element must be adjacent to the affix
        - Only thing not encoded in the lexical entry, it is not specific to any one lexical entry
      - If an affix, what kind of things result after c-selection
  - Lexical Entries - First Version
    - Lexical entry of a morpheme (= the implicit knowledge that a speaker has about it):
      - -er: c-selects `V` to form `N`
    - C-selection stands for category selection
    - The collection of lexical entries is called the lexicon



## Lecture 2:

- Compositionality
  - Locality of Selection Hypothesis: selection is local in the sense that an item can only select properties of its sister(s)
  - Tree Vocabulary:
    - Branch: a line connecting two parts of a tree
    - Node: each point that is labeled with a word or category, located at the end of a branch
    - Label: the name given to a node
    - Leaf (or terminal node): the nodes along the bottom of the tree
    - Mother: node `A` is a mother of `B` iff `A` is higher up in the tree than `B` and they are separated by a single branch (no intervening nodes)
    - Sister: two nodes are sisters if they share the same mother
  - Compounds and the RHHR
    - The English Right-Hand Head Rule: the rightmost element of a compound is the head of the word
    - What do we mean by head?
      - The head is the part of a linguistic structure that determines the distributions, the main meaning and the syntactic category of the whole structure
  - Affixes and the RHHR
    - What about affixes? Does the RHHR apply to them as well?
    - Yes, and as a result, suffixes and prefixes have a different status
      - Suffixes can change the category of a word
      - Prefixes cannot change the category of the stem they attach to
    - We can therefore extend the RHHR to all words:
      - The rightmost element of a word is the head of the word
    - Also we can assume that both free and bound morphemes belong to categories
      - Given the RHHR, we can then simplify our lexical entries
- Constituency
  - Constituency and Constituency Tests
    - One of the fundamental discoveries about the syntax of natural languages is that languages are chunky: words are organized into chunks or blocks of units that "rules" can manipulate as blocks
      - Languages don't just consist of strings of words, they have syntactic structure
    - Constituent: a group of words that function together as a unit
      - String that speakers can manipulate as a single chunk
    - How do we identify the parts of sentences that form units?
      - We use constituency tests
    - To correctly use a constituency test, we must follow rules
      - Constituency tests manipulate a string, and then we check whether the result is:
        - Grammatical
        - Consistent in meaning
      - Passing the test means the string is a constituent
      - Not passing the test means nothing
  - Stand Alone Test
    - If a group of words can stand alone, for example, as an answer to a question, they form a constituent
    - How it works:
      - Start with a string that you are interested in
      - Create a question that can be answered with the kind of string
      - If you can find a question that can be answered with this string, it is probably a constituent
  - Substitution
    - How it works:
      - Given a well-formed string `S` that we are trying to analyze:
        - Select a substring `SUB`
        - Replace `SUB` in kind by (what looks like) a monomorphic word (a word with no internal structure)
        - If the result `R` is well formed, we conclude that `SUB` is a constituent
        - If the result is ill formed, we conclude nothing
    - Logic of the test:
      - The smallest possible constituent consists of a single word
      - Any string of words that can be replaced by a single word while maintaining the same meaning is a constituent
    - Remember:
      - Original string and replacement should be minimal pairs
      - `S` and `R` have to be very close synonym
    - What can we infer from a successful substitution?
      - The initial phrase is a constituent
      - The initial phrase and its substitution share a distributional property (i.e., they belong to the same category)
      - In the tree structure, `SUB` is a subtree of `S`
    - What kinds of constituents can a pronoun replace?
      - It replaces `DP`s, it can't replace bare nominal phrases, `NP`s
    - What kinds of constituents can then/there replace?
      - `PP`s
    - What kinds of constituents can do so replace?
      - `VP`s
  - Summary
    - When carefully used, replacement can tell us about the constituency of sentence
    - A successful replacement shows that the replace string is a syntactic unit, i.e., constituent
    - In terms of trees:
      - A constituent is a node in the tree
      - Constituency tests reveal the major shape of the tree
