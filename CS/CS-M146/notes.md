## Lecture 1: Introduction

- What is Machine Learning?
  - Machine learning is the study of algorithms that improve on task `T` with respect to performance `P`, based on experience `E`
    - Example:
      - `T`: Recognizing handwritten words
      - `P`: Percentage of words correctly classified
      - `E`: Database of human-labeled images of handwritten words
  - A well-defined learning task is given by `<P, T, E>`
- Prerequisites
  - The pillars of machine learning
    - Probability and statistics
    - Linear algebra
    - Calculus/optimization
  - Computer science background
    - Algorithms
    - Programming experience
      - We will use Python and `scikit-learn`
- Goals of this Course
  - Fundamental concepts and algorithms
    - Customize your own algorithm
  - Common techniques/tools used
    - Theoretical understanding
    - Practical implementation
    - Best practices
  - How to "debug" an ML system
  - Black magic => systematic process
  - What will we learn?
    - Supervised learning
      - Decision tree, Perceptron, linear models, support vector machines, kernel methods, probabilistic models
    - Unsupervised learning
      - Clustering, EM algorithms
    - Learning theory
    - Deep learning (representation learning)
    - Practical issues
      - Experimental evaluation, implementing ML models
- Current Status
  - Compelling results on benchmarks
  - Works well in the general domain
  - Commercial uses
  - Challenges:
    - Incorporate with human knowledge
    - Reliable (fair, robust, interpretable) models that earn human trust
    - Applications in specific domains
    - Skewness of available annotation data
- Machine Learning is Interdisciplinary
  - Makes use of probability and statistics, linear algebra, calculus, theory of computation
  - Related to philosophy, psychology, neurobiology, linguistics, vision, robotics, etc.
  - Has applications in AI (natural language, vision, planning, HCI), engineering (agriculture, civil, etc.), and computer science (compilers, architecture, systems, databases, etc.)
