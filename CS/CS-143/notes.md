- Database Management System (DBMS)
  - What is a DBMS?
    - A system that manages massive amounts of data and provides convenient, efficient, persistent, and safe access to such data to many users simultaneously
- Database Architecture
  - Disk - "main memory"
    - OS - doesn't know how to efficiently cache data
      - DBMS engine - knows how to store data on disk to gain excellent performance, can use the underlying hardware directly, without going through the OS (raw I/O)
        - API - (JDBC/ODBC/PHP-MySQL)
          - Application
          - Command line interface
- Popular DBMS Software
  - Relational
    - Open source: MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
    - Closed source: Oracle, Microsoft SQL server, IBM DB2, etc.
  - Non-relational
    - MongoDB, Spark, etc.
  - Cloud
    - Amazon RDS, Azure SQL Database, Google Cloud Spanner, Oracle Database Cloud, etc.
- Database is Everywhere
  - All businesses manage various types of data
    - Online banking, Amazon, Walmart, phone backend systems, etc.
  - SQL is *the* language to interact with business-related data
    - Primary focus of the class
