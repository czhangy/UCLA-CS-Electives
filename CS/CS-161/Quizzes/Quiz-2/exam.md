## Problem 1

When the cost for each step is not identical, which of the following searching algorithms is optimal?

- Uniform-cost search
- DFS
- BFS
- Iterative Deepening

## Problem 2

Suppose the branching factor is `b` and the optimal solution is of depth `d`, then the space complexity of BFS is:

- `O(b^d)`
- `O(bd)`
- `O(d^b)`
- `O(1)`

## Problem 3

The key advantages of local search algorithms include: (select all that you believe is true)

- It usually takes less memory space.
- It always finds global optimum.
- It can find solutions even in a large state space.
- It always takes less time than global search algorithms.

## Problem 4

Suppose you were using a genetic algorithm and try to perform the crossover step on the following two individuals, represented as strings of integers: `1324421` and `2751421`, which of the following could be a possible result of performing crossover? (select all that you believe is true)

- `1321421` and `2754421`
- `1324421` and `2751421`
- None of the other options are possible.
- `1324421` and `2754421`
