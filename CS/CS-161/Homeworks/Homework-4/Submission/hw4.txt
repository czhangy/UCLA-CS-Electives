According to the RSat SAT solver, the SAT instance obtained from coloring
graph1.txt with 3 colors is unsatisfiable, however, the SAT instance obtained
from coloring the same graph with 4 colors is satisfiable. This tells us that
the graph described by graph1.txt requires at least 4 different colors to solve
in a graph coloring problem. An example solution based on the output of Rsat is
as follows:

    N = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 }, C = { Red, Green, Blue, Yellow }
    1 => Yellow
    2 => Blue
    3 => Green
    4 => Blue
    5 => Red
    6 => Green
    7 => Red

Through trial and error, it can be seen that the graph in graph2.txt requires
at least 8 distinct colors to solve. We know this because an SAT instance
generated with 7 colors is unsatisfiable, but an SAT instance generated with 8
colors is satisfiable.
