## Lecture 1: What is Artificial Intelligence?

- What is AI?
  - There are hundreds of definitions of AI
  - Thinking vs. Acting and Humanly vs. Rationally => 4 combinations
    - Thinking humanly: cognitive modeling, systems should solve problems the same way humans do
    - Thinking rationally: the use of logic, need to worry about modeling uncertainty and dealing with complexity
    - Acting humanly: the Turing Test approach
    - Acting rationally: the study of rational agents: agents that maximize the expected value of their performance measure given what they currently know
- Current Consensus Definition
  - AI is the study of intelligent, rational agents
    - Perception/sensing
    - Thinking/reasoning/inference
    - Acting
  - Environment => Percepts => Sensors => ? => Actuators => Action
  - For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is **expected** to maximize its **performance measure**, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has
- Rational Agents
  - "Expected": not perfect
  - No mention of humanly
  - Which performance measure?
    - $1.01 now or "1 in a million" chance of $1 million
- The AI Pipeline
  - World => (Observations/Data) => User/Agent => (Knowledge representation/Machine learning) => Model => Inference (Reasoning) => Action => World
- Strong vs. Weak AI
  - Weak AI: as if intelligent
  - Strong AI: actually intelligent
    - Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): hypothetical intelligence of a machine that has the capacity to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can
  - Most of current AI research is on Weak AI
- Brief History
  - 1940s: interest in neurons, neural networks, and their relationship to mathematics and learning
  - 1950s: Turing's paper
  - 1956: Dartmouth conference
  - 1950s and 1960s: enthusiasm and optimism; big promises
  - Late 1960s and 1970s: realization that further progress was really hard; disillusionment
  - 1980s: Expert Systems, neural networks, etc.; AI now a little different; quiet successes
  - 1990s to present: intelligent agents
  - 2000s: robot pets, self-driving cars
- Conclusions
  - This course: a reality check!
    - Knowledge representation formalisms
    - Automated reasoning and search algorithms
    - Bayesian networks
  - "We can see only a short distance ahead, but we can see that much remains to be done"
