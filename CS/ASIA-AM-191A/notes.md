## Lecture 1: GIS, Data, and Ethics

- GIS
  - What is GIS?
    - Data that is layered with time and/or space
    - Geographic Information Systems/Geographic Information Science
      - GISystems are the spatial tools
      - GIScience describes the spatial thinking
    - Ex) Google Maps, COVID maps, etc.
    - Exists in various forms
      - It can disempower or empower
  - Our Focus
    - Participatory/community-based GIS
    - Self-mobilizing
    - Ownership belongs to local people
- Data
  - Types of Data
    - Qualitative: data that describes the *qualities* of something
    - Quantitative; data that can be summarized into *quantities*
  - Effects of Data
    - Neglects those directly impacted by social problems
    - Knowable/controllable/rational/etc. nature does not support voices of community/power relations/power inequalities
  - Alternative Data Forms
    - Open data, humanitarian, crowdsources, participatory
- Ethics
  - What are Ethics?
    - Concerned about *how* and *why* we code/make maps
    - There are no "right" answers
      - *But* we should be able to defend why we chose a particular action

## Reading 1: Introduction to Critical Cartography

- Introduction: Cartography Undisciplined
  - Recently, cartography has been slipping from the control of the powerful elites that have exercised dominance over it for several hundred years
  - These elites have been challenged by two important developments:
    - The ability to make a map is now available to anyone through the Internet
      - Driven by open-source tools, mobile mapping apps, and geotagging
    - Maps are situated within specific relations of power, and not as neutral scientific documents
      - If a map is a specific set of power-knowledge claims, then other entities can make competing and equally powerful claims as those made by the state
  - These trends resist and challenge the received method and practice of mapping
    - We say that cartography is being undisciplined => freed from the confines of the academic and opened up to the people
  - Main argument:
    - Critique is political by nature
    - Today's critical movement is part of a longer cartographic critque
- What is Critique? A Critical Politics of Truth
