## Lecture 1: GIS, Data, and Ethics

- GIS
  - What is GIS?
    - Data that is layered with time and/or space
    - Geographic Information Systems/Geographic Information Science
      - GI-Systems are the spatial tools
      - GI-Science describes the spatial thinking
    - Ex) Google Maps, COVID maps, etc.
    - Exists in various forms
      - It can disempower or empower
  - Our Focus
    - Participatory/community-based GIS
    - Self-mobilizing
    - Ownership belongs to local people
- Data
  - Types of Data
    - Qualitative: data that describes the *qualities* of something
    - Quantitative; data that can be summarized into *quantities*
  - Effects of Data
    - Neglects those directly impacted by social problems
    - Knowable/controllable/rational/etc. nature does not support voices of community/power relations/power inequalities
  - Alternative Data Forms
    - Open data, humanitarian, crowdsources, participatory
- Ethics
  - What are Ethics?
    - Concerned about *how* and *why* we code/make maps
    - There are no "right" answers
      - *But* we should be able to defend why we chose a particular action



## Lecture 2: Hello, World

Nothing to see here!



## Lecture 3: Humanizing Technology

- Sectors of Society
  - Private/Government/Civil Society
  - Goal is to increase the influence of civil society in GIS
- Undisciplining Cartography
  - Not about "mapping accuracy" but about the *WHO* behind the ,aps

- Theme of the Week
  - Balancing critical tools with critical thinking

## Lecture 4: Leaflet

Nothing to see here!



## Lecture 5: Ethical Software and Developing for Civil Society

- Theme of the Week
  - How do you decide what technology is right?
- Open Source
  - Open-source vs. closed-source
    - You can see the code vs. you can never see the code
  - Issues with open-source
    - Detaches technology from ethics and treats it as "neutral"



## Lecture 6: GeoJSON

- The 3 Standards
  - Open source
  - Open standards
  - Open data

## Lecture 10: Designing Community-Focused Surveys

- Main Idea
  - Let the community speak for itself
  - We should not be making any "conclusions"
- Main Points
  - Test your survey
  - We are here to listen and empower, **NOT** take information and leave
  - Acknowledge and try to avoid as much bias as possible
  - Keep it short
- Why Test?
  - Respecting the community
  - Checking for Respect
    - Each question **MUST** have an important purpose
    - If a question is not necessary, **DO NOT** ask it because it would be "nice to know"
    - Less is more
    - Remember: each question takes someone's time
    - Remember: each survey contributes to survey fatigue
      - Every survey taken reduces the chance the same person will take a survey in the future
      - Make your survey pleasant and meaningful for everyone, another chance may not come
- We are here to Listen
  - **How** we listen is important
    - Access to the Internet may be limited
    - Language barriers
    - Dependent on networking
    - Limits to the above could create skewed responses
    - Focus on open-ended questions
    - Do not "lead" (i.e., try to get a specific answer) in questions both open-ended and closed
    - If you must include *closed-ended*, do not have:
      - Tons of options
      - Long options
- Avoiding Bias
  - Don't fall victim to confirmation bias
  - We should challenge our biases because:
    - Social problems are difficult to solve if we keep assuming (wrong) things
    - To facilitate social change better, we need to start breaking down those assumptions
  - How to minimize bias?
    - First and foremost, emphasize listening
    - It is impossible to understand every social problem, but we can start to address societal issues by listening to the people affected without assumptions first
    - Avoid jargon: ask simple questions with simple wording
    - Avoid assumptions: do not assume people know about your issue
    - Avoid leading: do not use subjective claims
    - Define definitions: explain terms if you must use them
- Keep it Short
  - For you and for them
  - A shorter survey = more space to share people's stories
  - Tie each question to **who** you are looking to empower
  - Open-ended questions = community members can take more time to respond if they want

## Lecture 12: Design Justice

- Web Design
  - Web design is the presentation part of web development
  - Mostly HTML/CSS
- Wireframes
  - Types of Wireframes
    - Analog
      - Pen and paper:
        - Boxes for website
        - Annotations for actions
    - Digital
      - Pen/Whiteboard
        - More free form
        - Easily do multiple iterations
    - Low Fidelity
      - Boxes for content
      - Placeholder text
  - Why Wireframes?
    - They connect UX to UI
    - Makes sure you have an idea of what you're doing before you commit to doing it
  - Tools for Wireframing
    - Analog
      - Pen
      - Pencil
      - Paper
      - Post-its
    - Digital
      - Figma/FigJam
      - Canva
      - Draw.io
      - Adobe Sketch
      - PowerPoint
      - Adobe Illustrator
- Human Centered Design
  - Putting UX at the center of your design
- Design Justice
  - Not an ideal or theory
  - A holistic solutions framework and approach to rebalance society and technology by focusing on marginalized communities
  - Principles:
    - Use design to sustain, heal, and empower communities
    - Center voices directly impacted by design
    - Prioritize design's impact on the community instead of designer's intentions
    - Everyone is an expert based on their own lived experiences
  - Reflect:
    - How close am I to the issue at hand?
    - Does this community want me to work on this project?
    - Am I the appropriate person to work on this project?
    - How can I step back and facilitate the design of solutions by the community?
