## Lecture 1: GIS, Data, and Ethics

- GIS
  - What is GIS?
    - Data that is layered with time and/or space
    - Geographic Information Systems/Geographic Information Science
      - GI-Systems are the spatial tools
      - GI-Science describes the spatial thinking
    - Ex) Google Maps, COVID maps, etc.
    - Exists in various forms
      - It can disempower or empower
  - Our Focus
    - Participatory/community-based GIS
    - Self-mobilizing
    - Ownership belongs to local people
- Data
  - Types of Data
    - Qualitative: data that describes the *qualities* of something
    - Quantitative; data that can be summarized into *quantities*
  - Effects of Data
    - Neglects those directly impacted by social problems
    - Knowable/controllable/rational/etc. nature does not support voices of community/power relations/power inequalities
  - Alternative Data Forms
    - Open data, humanitarian, crowdsources, participatory
- Ethics
  - What are Ethics?
    - Concerned about *how* and *why* we code/make maps
    - There are no "right" answers
      - *But* we should be able to defend why we chose a particular action



## Lecture 2: Hello, World

Nothing to see here!



## Lecture 3: Humanizing Technology

- Sectors of Society
  - Private/Government/Civil Society
  - Goal is to increase the influence of civil society in GIS
- Undisciplining Cartography
  - Not about "mapping accuracy" but about the *WHO* behind the ,aps

- Theme of the Week
  - Balancing critical tools with critical thinking

## Lecture 4: Leaflet

Nothing to see here!



## Lecture 5: Ethical Software and Developing for Civil Society

- Theme of the Week
  - How do you decide what technology is right?
- Open Source
  - Open-source vs. closed-source
    - You can see the code vs. you can never see the code
  - Issues with open-source
    - Detaches technology from ethics and treats it as "neutral"



## Lecture 6: GeoJSON

- The 3 Standards
