## Lecture 3: Basic JS

- Use of `<script>` tag with `src` attribute to inject JS into HTML
  - Use `defer` attribute to force HTML to be parsed first, and then load the JS after
- Use JS to make your pages interactive
- Primitives
  - `string`, `number`, `bigInt`, `boolean`, `undefined`, `simple`
  - `typeof` can be used to determine the type of a literal/variable
- `null`
  - Type `object`
  - Used for values that were previously assigned and are now unassigned
- Typing
  - JS is dynamically typed
  - Variables may change types between assignments
  - `const` keyword prevents the value of variables from being changed after declaration
