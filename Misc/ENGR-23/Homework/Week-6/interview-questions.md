# Dream Internship Interview Qs

## Company & Job Title

Microsoft SWE

## Question 1

**Q: Why Microsoft?**

A: My professional experience in software has so far taken the form of working in web development for small organizations. While this has given me a great opportunity to learn by doing and actively help my local community, as I move forward with my career, I'm looking to continue growing as a developer. To me, this means applying my skillset to new things and learning beyond what I'm comfortable with. I find that Microsoft offers a way for me to engage with innovative tech that continues to give me the chance to help others with my work, and does so in a work environment that I can identify with.

## Question 2

**Q: What has been your favorite project or proudest accomplishment? Why?**

A: My favorite project so far has been my DARS++ full-stack application that I developed this past summer. I started the project in response to struggles my friends and I have had with course planning throughout our time in college. This project was the first time I had ever taken something from conception all the way to "production" by myself, and I had a really great time learning and problem-solving along the way. Now that the base functionality of the app is complete, it's also been great to see the friends I've linked it to actually using it for future course planning, and I'm excited to continue developing it further when I have the time.

## Question 3

**Q: What are you most looking for in your next role and why is it important to you?**

A: The biggest thing I’m looking for is a role that will challenge me and force me to go beyond what I already know. Obviously, I want to take my time in college to learn and grow as a developer, and I believe that can only happen if I’m forced to go outside of my comfort zone. I’ve spent a significant amount of time in my current positions dealing with our products and designing them, but since I've only worked in small organizations, I lack the experience that comes with working on larger projects with a higher scope.

## Question 4

**Q: Tell us about your contributions to a recent project. What was the impact of the project?**

A: In my current position at BruinShack, I worked on the prototyping of our application's review system. This involved designing the user flow of the system, while also giving input into how users on the client-side would be allowed to interact with our data on the server side. Since we had a small team at the time, much of this design, as well as the development of a system that was pushed into production, was left to me. I first focused on implementing a clean frontend, before collaborating with my lead to establish what our backend would look like. The final design of the system focused on establishing credibility for our website by allowing student tenants to submit their own, unbiased reviews of the apartments they had lived in, while also keeping in mind that the system needed to be pushed to production before the end of the school year to match the incoming spike of users looking for apartments for next year. I implemented the rest of the system with these guidelines in mind, and the review system remains as a core feature that our userbase interacts with, according to our analytics.

## Question 5

**Q: Describe a time you had to act in a leadership role.**

A: Over the summer at my position in BruinShack, our development team took on a huge expansion of team members. As the dev with the most experience with our codebase, I took on a pseudo-leadership role in our team. Throughout the quarter I helped onboard new members and give advice to expedite the process of familiarizing themselves with our codebase. In the process, I learned a lot about how to interact with others in a sort of mentor-mentee relationship and was happy to pass on what I had learned in my time with the organization and the mistakes to avoid.

## Question 6

**Q: What is an example of how you've faced innovation in your life?**

A: Obviously, innovation is all around us in the modern day. Personally, as someone who grew up around a lot of video games, I see them as a relatively unexplored facet of this innovation. In my mind, they offer a brand new medium for storytelling, education, entertainment, you name it. In my life, they've given a lot to me in the form of a community I can identify myself with and a source of inspiration and imagination. Right now, they mainly serve to provide entertainment for a relatively small subset of people, but I think the potential that lies with them is immense and needs to be explored.

## Question 7

**Q: Tell me about yourself.**

A: My name is Charles Zhang and I'm a computer science major at UCLA, graduating in June of 2023. I have about a year of professional experience in web development with various small organizations in my local community. Moving forward, I'm looking for ways to grow as a developer while expanding my reach in terms of the people I can help with my work. Obviously, Microsoft is very much on the forefront of innovation in the industry, and I believe your wide breadth of products is perfect for helping me reach my goals.

## Question 8

**Q: What is your biggest strength?**

A: I would say my biggest strength is my self-awareness. I know how my own mind works really well, which means I know how best to learn new things, organize my time, and keep myself motivated. In my current position, this has really helped smooth my transition into my role, as I was able to pick up the tech stack quickly by keeping myself on track and knowing when to ask for help. Considering this is a small organization, this allowed me to make significant contributions to our product early on.

## Question 9

**Q: What is your biggest weakness?**

A: I would say my biggest weakness is my fear of failure. I think that in the past, this has certainly acted as a sort of paralytic, stopping me from taking all the opportunities presented to me and impeding my workflow. As I've moved through college, and especially with the last few job application cycles, I've been forced to confront this fear and work on myself in order to succeed. While there's still a lot of work to be done on my end, I think that I've gotten more willing to push myself out of my comfort zone.

## Question 10

**Q: What’s a time you disagreed with a decision that was made at work?**

A: Last year, the team I was working with had made a sudden expansion, and we picked up a UI/UX team to complement our dev team. Being a small organization facing this rapid change, we didn't really make an effort to establish formal lines of communications between the new team and ours. As a result, I ended up developing an old design for a critical system that needed to be pushed out by the end of the quarter. However, the new design team had actually redesigned the system while I was doing this, resulting in a waste of a couple weeks' worth of my time. After this occurred, I brought these concerns up to our founder, and together, we worked to establish a system where each developer is paired up with a designer to encourage teams to be transparent about what they're doing and to make sure no more overlap occurs.
