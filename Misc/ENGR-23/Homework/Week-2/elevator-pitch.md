# Elevator Pitch

Hello, I’m Charles Zhang, I grew up in the South Bay area, and I’m a third-year computer science major studying at UCLA. I've worked in a couple web development positions for small organizations, which have allowed me to develop professional experience with tools such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Node and Express, as well as working in an Agile environment. Through projects, I've also gotten the opportunity to reinforce this knowledge with work on databases and building a product from the ground up. I'm here to look for a position that can not only help me grow as an engineer, but also continue to allow me to help others with my work. While my current positions have allowed to be directly impact my local communities, I'm looking for the opportunity to extend that reach to a wider scope. 



## Yahoo

As I understand it, Yahoo offers a wide variety of platforms, ranging from finance to sports, so I believe Yahoo gives me the chance to touch on that mission, while also learning benefitting from your collaborative environment. Would you happen to know if any of these teams are looking for a SWE intern for the upcoming summer?



## IXL

Personally, I see education as one of the most important aspects in our society. Having used IXL as a kid, I truly appreciated how it streamlined learning topics so that even young kids could find enjoyment in schoolwork. I think contributing to this platform would be a great way for me to continue my journey, and I was wondering if there was any need for intern assistance in the coming summer.



## Los Angeles Dodgers

Throughout the years, I've built up a deep interest for sports, and a belief that they can be a strong force that brings communities together. I think that contributing to your organization would be a great way to continue on my mission towards helping others in an environment vastly different from traditional tech firms. With that said, what kind of tech-related endeavors do the Dodgers have planned for the near future, and would there be room for any intern contribution?
