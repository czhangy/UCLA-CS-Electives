  - Know the basic types of financial management decisions and the role of the Financial Manager
  - Know the financial implications of the various forms of business organization
  - Know the goal of financial management
  - Understand the conflicts of interest that can arise between owners and managers
- What is Corporate Finance (or any kind of finance for that matter)?
  - Finance addresses the following 3 questions:
    - What long-term investments should the firm choose? - **capital budgeting**
      - I'm going to be producing things -> in order to produce these things, I need long-term investments
      - Ex) Dropbox needed servers (buy or rent?)
        - Buying is a long-term investment, renting is short-term
    - How should the firm raise funds for the selected investments? - **capital structure**
      - 2 major ways of financing - source determines the capital structure:
        - Debt - loans
          - Have to be paid back, no involvement in decision-making
        - Equity - the owner's money, friends, family, other investors, etc.
          - Include intellectually aligned people as the first investors
          - Doesn't have to be paid back, will be involved in decision-making
    - How should short-term assets be managed and financed? - **net working capital**
      - Refers to the difference between the funding of the company (capital structure) and the short-term buffer zone of assets
      - Dealing with day-to-day business
- What would you think about before investing in a company?
  - Need vs. want of product
    - If a product is a need, what do they bring to the table compared to competitors?
      - Account for **saturated markets**
  - Commitment of the CEO
    - Horse-jockey relationship: the CEO and the idea matter
  - Think about risk
    - Possible risk of the industry as a whole? (litigation, FDA, etc.)
    - Small companies (single points of failure, low margin of error)
  - How is the product distributed?
    - What **channels** are being used?
  - Many more factors must be taken into consideration
- **Balance sheets**
  - What does the company have?
    - **Asset** - anything the company owns (cash, equipment, etc.)
  - Looks at the company at one point in time
    - Like a picture of their finances at a single moment
    - Asks how much of it comes from capital budgeting, capital structure, and net working capital
  - LHS: total value of assets
    - **Current assets** - the assets that can be turned into cash in a short period of time (within 1 year)
      - Short-term assets
      - Liquid assets
      - Definition may change based on industry
    - **Fixed assets**
      - Long-term assets
      - Intangible vs. Tangible
  - RHS: total firm value to investors (sometimes found below LHS)
    - **Current liabilities** - short-term debt (must be paid within 1 year)
    - **Long-term debt**
    - **Shareholders' equity**
      - Money coming from owners
      - Money coming from within the company



## Lecture 2:

- Balance Sheet Model of the Firm

  - Tells us what the company has (assets) and what they owe (funds)
  - Must be provided to the public by law
  - RHS shows the source of the assets
    - Owner's own money => shareholders' equity
    - There's nothing left on the RHS, it just documents the source of the assets side
  - LHS and RHS should always be balanced
    - Money coming into the RHS is used to add to something on the LHS
    - Could put it into current assets as cash, buy equipment (fixed asset) etc.
    - When debt is paid off, it is subtracted from, the RHS

  - Fixed assets => what long-term assets should the firm choose? => capital budgeting
  - Long-term debt + Shareholders' equity => how should the firm raise funds for the selected investments? => capital structure
    - Depends on the industry, age of the company, risk aversion level, etc.
    - What portion of the company is funded by debt/what portion is funded by equity?
  - Current liabilities + Current assets => how should short-term assets be managed and financed => net working capital
    - **Current assets** - anything that can be and is intended to be liquidated in 1 year without major loss in value
    - Companies should operate with positive NWC => difference between current assets and current liabilities
      - May be negative for a period of time after situations involving massive cash outflow
        - If for an extended period of time, worrisome, cannot pay back debt
        - Should not occur if company operates at a loss as a whole

- The Balance Sheet

  - An accountant's snapshot of the firm's accounting value at a specific point in time
  - The balance sheet's identity is Assets == Liabilities + Stockholder's Equity
  - Usually compiled at the end of a quarter
    - 10Q - quarterly, 10K - annually
  - Current assets:
    - Cash and equivalents
    - Accounts receivable => companies make money off of credit, money not obtained yet
    - Inventories => relevant for some industries, not for others
      - World moving towards intangible production (72% in the US)
      - Looking to sell within a year => inventory management is very important
    - Other => shouldn't be too large to avoid SEC investigation
    - Compare splits of LHS to the industry standard
      - More in current assets => current assets don't make money, sub-optimal distribution
        - Short-term - no trouble paying short-term debts
  - Fixed assets:
    - Record everything at cost
    - Use straight-line depreciation to model depreciation of fixed assets
      - Linear depreciation recorded in less accumulated depreciation
    - Intangible assets - IPs, service sector, etc.
      - **Amortization** - depreciation of intangible assets
  - Liabilities
    - Current Liabilities
      - Accounts payable
        - Amount of supply you haven't paid for yet
      - Notes payable == short-term debt
        - Borrowed money
      - Accrued expenses
        - Utilities
    - Long-term liabilities
      - Deferred taxes - pre-arranged delay of tax-paying
      - Long-term debt - bonds
        - Bond market is huge, traded by big institutions
  - Stockholder's equity
    - Preferred stock
    - Common stock
      - Stocks that owners sell, no promise of future payment
    - Capital surplus
      - Stocks + this is the total you get by selling shares
    - Accumulated retained earnings
      - Profit from operation



## Reading 1: Introduction to Corporate Finance

- What is Corporate Finance?
  - In starting a firm, you make in investment in assets like inventory, machinery, land, and labor while matching that investment with cash raised through financing => basis of value creation
  - The Balance Sheet Model of the Firm
    - Financial snapshot of the firm and its activities at a single point in time

    - Try to buy assets that generate more cash than they cost
    - Sell bonds and stocks and other financial instruments that raise more cash than they cost
    - In essence, the firm must create more cash flow than it uses
      - Cash flows paid to bondholders and stockholders of the firm should be greater than the cash flows they put into the firm
  - Identification of Cash Flows
    - Sometimes not easy to identify cash flows
    - Much of the information we obtain is within accounting statements
      - Extraction of cash flow information from these statements is the work of financial analysis

        - Sales, market share, cost control
      - Controlling risk 
        - Bankruptcy avoidance, stability, and safety
      - Tend to be contradictory, need a goal that encompasses both factors
  - The Goal of Financial Management
    - What is a good financial management decision?
      - Good decisions increase the value of the stock, and poor decisions decrease the value of the stock
    - Goal: maximize the current value per share of the existing stock
      - No ambiguity, no short-run vs. long-run debate
      - Since stockholders are paid after everyone else, if they're winning, so is everyone else
  - A More General Goal
    - What is the appropriate goal when the firm has no traded stock
    - More general goal: maximize the value of the existing owners' equity
      - Doesn't include illegal/unethical action
      - Financial manager best serves the owners of the business by identifying goods and services that add value to the firm because they are desired and valued in the free marketplace
- The Agency Problem and Control of the Corporation
  - In large corporations, ownership can be spread over a huge number of stockholders

        - Direct costs come in 2 forms
          - Corporate expenditure that benefits management but costs the stockholders
          - Expense that arises from the need to monitor management actions
    - Left to themselves, managers would tend to maximize the amount of resources over which have control (corporate power/wealth)
      - Could lead to overemphasis on corporate size or growth
  - Do Managers Act in the Stockholders' Interests?
    - Depends on 2 factors:
      - How closely are management goals aligned with stockholder goals?
        - Partially dependent on manner of compensation
      - Can managers be replaced if they do not pusue stockholder goals?
    - Managerial Compensation
      - Management will frequently have a significant economic incentive to increase share value for two reasons:
        - Managerial compensation is usually tied to financial performance in general and share value in particular
          - Able to buy stock at a bargain price => leads to dependence on increasing stockholders' value
        - Job prospects
          - Better performers in the firm will get promoted
          - Managers who are more successful in pursuing stockholder goals will be in greater demand in the labor market => they command larger salaries
    - Control of the Firm
      - Ultimately rests with stockholders => they elect directors who hire and fire management
      - **Proxy fight** - valuable mechanism by which a group solicits proxies to replace the existing board and thereby replace existing management
        - **Proxy** - the authority to vote someone else's stock
      - Firms that are poorly managed are more vulnerable to takeover
        - Greater profit potential exists
    - Stockholders control the firm and stockholder wealth maximization is the relevant goal of the corporation
      - Management goals may still be pursued at the expense of the stockholders
