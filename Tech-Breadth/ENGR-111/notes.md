## Lecture 1: Introduction to Finance

- Key Concepts and Skills
  - Know the basic types of financial management decisions and the role of the Financial Manager
  - Know the financial implications of the various forms of business organization
  - Know the goal of financial management
  - Understand the conflicts of interest that can arise between owners and managers
- What is Corporate Finance (or any kind of finance for that matter)?
  - Finance addresses the following 3 questions:
    - What long-term investments should the firm choose? - **capital budgeting**
      - I'm going to be producing things -> in order to produce these things, I need long-term investments
      - Ex) Dropbox needed servers (buy or rent?)
        - Buying is a long-term investment, renting is short-term
    - How should the firm raise funds for the selected investments? - **capital structure**
      - 2 major ways of financing - source determines the capital structure:
        - Debt - loans
          - Have to be paid back, no involvement in decision-making
        - Equity - the owner's money, friends, family, other investors, etc.
          - Include intellectually aligned people as the first investors
          - Doesn't have to be paid back, will be involved in decision-making
    - How should short-term assets be managed and financed? - **net working capital**
      - Refers to the difference between the funding of the company (capital structure) and the short-term buffer zone of assets
      - Dealing with day-to-day business
- What would you think about before investing in a company?
  - Need vs. want of product
    - If a product is a need, what do they bring to the table compared to competitors?
      - Account for **saturated markets**
  - Commitment of the CEO
    - Horse-jockey relationship: the CEO and the idea matter
  - Think about risk
    - Possible risk of the industry as a whole? (litigation, FDA, etc.)
    - Small companies (single points of failure, low margin of error)
  - How is the product distributed?
    - What **channels** are being used?
  - Many more factors must be taken into consideration
- **Balance sheets**
  - What does the company have?
    - **Asset** - anything the company owns (cash, equipment, etc.)
  - Looks at the company at one point in time
    - Like a picture of their finances at a single moment
    - Asks how much of it comes from capital budgeting, capital structure, and net working capital
  - LHS: total value of assets
    - **Current assets** - the assets that can be turned into cash in a short period of time (within 1 year)
      - Short-term assets
      - Liquid assets
      - Definition may change based on industry
    - **Fixed assets**
      - Long-term assets
      - Intangible vs. Tangible
  - RHS: total firm value to investors (sometimes found below LHS)
    - **Current liabilities** - short-term debt (must be paid within 1 year)
    - **Long-term debt**
    - **Shareholders' equity**
      - Money coming from owners
      - Money coming from within the company



## Lecture 2: The Balance Sheet

- Balance Sheet Model of the Firm

  - Tells us what the company has (assets) and what they owe (funds)
  - Must be provided to the public by law
  - RHS shows the source of the assets
    - Owner's own money => shareholders' equity
    - There's nothing left on the RHS, it just documents the source of the assets side
  - LHS and RHS should always be balanced
    - Money coming into the RHS is used to add to something on the LHS
    - Could put it into current assets as cash, buy equipment (fixed asset) etc.
    - When debt is paid off, it is subtracted from, the RHS

  - Fixed assets => what long-term assets should the firm choose? => capital budgeting
  - Long-term debt + Shareholders' equity => how should the firm raise funds for the selected investments? => capital structure
    - Depends on the industry, age of the company, risk aversion level, etc.
    - What portion of the company is funded by debt/what portion is funded by equity?
  - Current liabilities + Current assets => how should short-term assets be managed and financed => net working capital
    - **Current assets** - anything that can be and is intended to be liquidated in 1 year without major loss in value
    - Companies should operate with positive NWC => difference between current assets and current liabilities
      - May be negative for a period of time after situations involving massive cash outflow
        - If for an extended period of time, worrisome, cannot pay back debt
        - Should not occur if company operates at a loss as a whole

- The Balance Sheet

  - An accountant's snapshot of the firm's accounting value at a specific point in time
  - The balance sheet's identity is Assets == Liabilities + Stockholder's Equity
  - Usually compiled at the end of a quarter
    - 10Q - quarterly, 10K - annually
  - Current assets:
    - Cash and equivalents
    - Accounts receivable => companies make money off of credit, money not obtained yet
    - Inventories => relevant for some industries, not for others
      - World moving towards intangible production (72% in the US)
      - Looking to sell within a year => inventory management is very important
    - Other => shouldn't be too large to avoid SEC investigation
    - Compare splits of LHS to the industry standard
      - More in current assets => current assets don't make money, sub-optimal distribution
        - Short-term - no trouble paying short-term debts
  - Fixed assets:
    - Record everything at cost
    - Use straight-line depreciation to model depreciation of fixed assets
      - Linear depreciation recorded in less accumulated depreciation
    - Intangible assets - IPs, service sector, etc.
      - **Amortization** - depreciation of intangible assets
  - Liabilities
    - Current Liabilities
      - Accounts payable
        - Amount of supply you haven't paid for yet
      - Notes payable == short-term debt
        - Borrowed money
      - Accrued expenses
        - Utilities
    - Long-term liabilities
      - Deferred taxes - pre-arranged delay of tax-paying
      - Long-term debt - bonds
        - Bond market is huge, traded by big institutions
  - Stockholder's equity
    - Preferred stock
    - Common stock
      - Stocks that owners sell, no promise of future payment
    - Capital surplus
      - Stocks + this is the total you get by selling shares
    - Accumulated retained earnings
      - Profit from operation



## Lecture 3: Corporations

- The Corporate Firm

  - The corporate form of business is the standard method f-or solving the problems encounters in raising large amounts of cash

  - However, businesses can take other forms

  - A Comparison:

    - |                                      | Corporation                      | Partnership                                                  |
      | :----------------------------------: | :------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
      |            **Liquidity**             | Shares can be easily exchanged   | Subject to substantial restrictions                          |
      |          **Voting Rights**           | Usually each share gets one vote | General Partner is in charge; limited partners may have some voting rights |
      |             **Taxation**             | Double                           | Partners pay taxes on distributions                          |
      | **Reinvestment and dividend payout** | Broad latitude                   | All net cash flow is distributed to partners                 |
      |            **Liability**             | Limited liability                | General partners may have unlimited liability; limited partners enjoy limited liability |
      |            **Continuity**            | Perpetual life                   | Limited life                                                 |

  - Enables risk taking by separating the business from the person

  - Pros and Cons of Going Public

    - Pros:
      - Obtain money that does not have to be repaid
      - Increased visibility when the company IPOs
      - Market valuation => how much the company is valued at
        - Pricing very delicate, your company is unique, so how do you determine the price at IPO?
        - Don't want stock too high => instant drops are bad for optics
        - Don't want stock too low => missing potential revenue
    - Cons:
      - Going public is costly
        - Hiring intermediary financial advisors to determine stock pricing, insurance, etc.
        - Selling stock happens very rarely after IPO
          - Costly
          - Selling new stock means selling new percentage (your share) or diluting the existing stock (bad for investors)
          - Companies simply go into debt
      - Management loses some of its freedom to act without board approval
      - Open to scrutiny
      - Public reporting
      - Company maybe taken over
        - Stocks being sold and traded => allows one big company to buy up and takeover

- The Importance of Cash Flow

  - Ultimately, the firm must be a cash generating activity
  - The cash flows from the firm must exceed the cash flows from the financial markets
  - Flow diagram:
    - Financial markets => Firm issues securities => Firm
      - Financial instruments that you sell to the public in an effort to collect money
        - Loans/bonds (long-term debt) or stocks (equity)
    - Firm => Cash flow from firm => dividends and debt payments => financial markets
    - Firm => Cash flow from firm => taxes => government
    - Firm => Cash flow from firm => retained cash flows => firm

- The Goal of Financial Management

  - What is the correct goal?
    - Maximize profit?
    - Minimize costs?
    - Maximize market share?
    - Maximize shareholder wealth?
      - The one aspect that provides a summary for the rest

- The Agency Problem

  - Agency relationship
    - Principal hires an agent to represent his/her interest
    - Stockholders (principals) hire managers (agents) to run the company
  - Agency problem
    - Conflict of interest between principal and agent

- Balance Sheet

  - Preferred stock: reserved for initial investors
    - May offer a certain payment regularly
  - Par value: initial predicted stock price at IPO
  - Capital surplus: difference between the amount of money collected from the market and the par value of the stock
  - Accumulated retained earnings: the amount of money kept in the company from your profit
    - If growing, retained earnings will grow
    - If you make a loss, retained earnings will decrease
    - Less treasury stock: the company buying back its own shares (negative value)
    - Links the balance sheet and the income statement
      - A video recording of the company



## Lecture 4: Income Statement

- The Balance Sheet
  - The company is doing poorly, decides to dissolve
    - All assets are going to be sold
      - The debtors will be the first to be paid
      - If the assets cannot be sold to match the debt (book price > market price), the debtors have to negotiate with the company for repay
        - They may sue, may get a haircut (a percentage less than what their owed)
    - The stockholders will be the next to be paid
  - Company may buy its own stock to signal to the market that its undervalued
    - May be an attempt to regain control
    - EPS - Earnings per Share
      - Company wants EPS to increase steadily => drastic increases set unrealistic expectations for stockholders
      - `EPS = Share earnings / # of outstanding shares`
        - Can reduce the number of shares to increase the EPS articifically
  - Assets are listed in order of liquidity
    - Cash => accounts receivable => inventories
- Balance Sheet Analysis
  - When analyzing a balalnce sheet, the finance manager should look at:
    - Liquidity
    - Debt vs. Equity
    - Value vs. cost (book vs. market value)
      - Under GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), audited financial statements of firms in the US carry assets at cost
      - Market value is the price at which the assets, liabilities, and equity could actually be bought or sold, which is a completely different concept from historical cost
    - Balance sheet doesn't include some of the most valuable things a company has
      - Future potential
- The Income Statement
  - Measures financial performance over a specific period of time
  - The accounting definition of income is: `Revenue - Expenses = Income`
  - Operating section
    - Total operating revenues (+)
    - COGS (Cost of goods sold) - amount of money spent on the materials used to make the product (-)
    - SG&A (Selling, general, and administrative expenses) - labor + marketing + real estate used to make the product (-)
    - Depreciation - reduction of the value of a machine to be taken off as cost (-)
      - Only accounts for the current year => balance sheet takes care of gross and net depreciation
    - Add top 4 to get operating income (hopefully positive)
      - Company with positive operating income but negative net income is good candidate for takeover
        - Good product, bad management
  - Net income from income statement can go to one of two places:
    - Retained earnings: stays in the company
    - Dividends: paid out
  - Relation to balance sheet
    - Income statement records all costs and revenue
      - Depreciation is a non-cost item => the calculated profit on the balance sheet is an underestimate of the actual profit
      - This underestimate goes to retained earnings on the balance sheet
        - Assets would go up by more than the equity went up => fixed by recording depreciation on the balance sheet



## Lecture 5: Income Statement Analysis

- Balance sheet
  - Accumulated retained earnings only change when money is made and kept in the company, or a loss is made
    - Money made that stays in the company is added to accumulated retained earnings under equity, which is balanced out by some kind of assets
      - It could also be used to pay debt, in which case both sides would decrease
  - Stock only changes when the company buys or sells stock directly (at IPO)
- Income statements
  - Record the flow variables of a business
  - Operating section:
    - Total operating revenues - record sales from main business only, other profits go under other income
      - Deduct COGS, SG&A, and depreciation to get operating income
    - Cost of goods sold - amount of money spent on the materials used to make the product
      - Can be valuable for comparison => record all costs under the correct headings
    - Selling, general, and administration expenses
    - Operating income tells us if the main company is making money
      - If negative, it tells us that the company isn't valuable to society
    - Other income represents income changes that occur outside of the core function of the company
  - Non-operating section:
    - Operating income + other income = EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes)
    - Interest payments
    - EBIT - interest = pretax income
  - Taxes section:
    - Taxes - current and deferred
    - Pretax - taxes = net income/"the bottom line"
      - Split into retained earnings and dividends => ratio of dividends to net income is the dividend payout ratio
        - `1 - dividend payout ratio = retention ratio`
        - `1 - d = b`
    - When the interest is higher, the tax is lower
- How can we purchase a fixed asset?
  - Use immediate liquid funds
  - Sell stocks
  - Sell bonds
  - Wait for more income
  - 2 major ways:
    - Debt - you have to pay it back on a certain date with interest
      - What if the company is struggling on that date?
      - Good if you can get it with low interest
      - Can deduct interest expenses on the income statement, allowing you to reduce taxes
    - Equity
- Distributing dividends
  - Split companies into 2: mature companies and
    - Mature companies - stable, expected to have a consistent dividend payout ratio
  - Goes to both common and preferred stockholders
- Stock split
  - You start your company and sell your stock and collect your money
  - In the secondary market, your stock starts to go up as it's traded
  - If the price of your stock gets too high, then only a limited group of people can buy it
  - To avoid your stock being concentrated in one source, you perform a stock split
  - `x:1` split => 1 stock becomes `x` stocks
  - Attempt to disperse stocks over the public
  - Data is smoothed out using econometric models so that long-term analysis is possible
- Income Statement Analysis
  - 3 things to keep in mind: GAAP, non-cash items, time and cost
  - Non-cash items
    - Depreciation is the most apparent
    - Another non-cash item is deferred taxes, which does not represent a cash flow
    - Net income is not cash
    - Cash flow statements
      - Accounting cash flow
      - Financial cash flow
  - Time and Costs
    - In the short-run, certain equipment, resources, and commitments of the firm are fixed, but the firm can vary such inputs as labor and raw materials
    - In the long-run, all inputs of production (and hence costs) are variable
    - Financial accountants do not distinguish between variable costs and fixed costs
      - Accounting costs usually fit into a classification that distinguishes product costs from period costs
- Taxes
  - The one thing we can rely on with taxes is that they are always changing
  - Marginal vs. average tax rates
    - Marginal - the percentage paid on the next dollar earned
    - Average - the tax bill / taxable income
  - Other taxes
- Cash Flow Statement
  - Cash flow from assets, cash flow from bonds, cash flow from stock
    - `C(A)`
      - Operating cash flow (OCF): EBIT + depreciation - tax
        - Can change net working capital
        - Can change fixed assets
          - Can calculate these by looking at the balance sheet
      - Leftover cash goes to debtholders to pay interest (`C(B)`) and to dividends/buying back stock (`C(S)`)
      - For companies making a loss, cash doesn't flow from operating side to bond/stockholders, it flows the other direction



## Lecture 6: Financial Ratios

- Ratio Analysis
  - Ratios allow for better comparison through time or between companies
  - As we look at each ratio, ask yourself:
    - How is the ratio computed?
    - What is the ratio trying to measure and why?
    - What is the unit of measurement?
    - What does the value indicate?
    - How can we improve the company's value?
  - When comparing companies, take into account industry, size, etc.
- Categories of Financial Ratios
  - Short-term solvency or liquidity ratios
    - Current ratio = `CA / CL`
      - Same information as NWC
    - Quick ratio = `(CA - inventory) / CL`
    - Cash ratio = `Cash / CL`
    - What does having high short-term solvency ratios imply?
      - They can pay their short-term debt
      - Too high ratios can indicate complacency
  - Long-term solvency or financial leverage ratios
    - Total debt ratio = `(A - E) / A`
    - Debt-equity = `D / E`
    - Equity multiplier = `A / E = 1 + D / E`
    - What does having high short-term solvency ratios imply?
      - Could be bad if the company can't pay back debt
      - Could be good if the company can leverage the debt to produce assets
  - Coverage ratios
    - Times interest earned = `EBIT / Interest`
    - Cash coverage = `EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization / Interest`
  - Inventory ratios
    - Inventory turnover = `COGS / Inventory`
      - Days' sales in inventory = `365 / Inventory Turnover`
  - Receivables ratios
    - Receivables turnover = `Sales / Accounts Receivable`
    - Day's sales in receivables = `365 / receivables turnover`
  - Total asset turnover
    - Total asset turnover = `Sales / Total Assets`
    - Low if you're a capital intensive industry
  - Profitability measures
    - Profit margin = `Net Income / Sales`
    - Return on assets = `Net Income / Total Assets`
    - Return on equity = `Net Income / Total Equity`



## Lecture 7: Financial Planning

- Computing Profitability Measures
  - Profit Margin = Net Income / Sales
  - ROA = Net Income / Total Assets
  - ROE = Net Income / Total Equity
- Du-Pont Identity
  - `ROE = NI / E`
  - `ROE = (NI / E) x (Assets / Assets) x (Sales / Sales)`
  - `ROE = (NI / Sales) x (Sales / Assets) x (Assets / Equity)`
  - `ROE = Profit Margin x Total Asset Turnover x Equity Multiplier`
- Computing Market Value Measures
  - `Earning Per Share = NI / Shares Outstanding`
    - Important for investors
  - `PE Ratio = Price per share / Earnings per share`
    - Indicates the relationship between the existing and future valuation of the company
    - High PE ratio could be good or bad
      - Good => may indicate high expectations from investors, good for growth companies that can back it up
      - Bad => may not live up to the hype and crash back to industry standard
  - `Market Capitalization = Price per share x Shares Outstanding`
    - Give an immediate valuation of a company
    - Starting point for determining the value of a company, like size of the balance sheet
      - The balance sheet doesn't take context into account
      - Stock price doesn't accurately reflect the values of a company, other factors may impact it as well

- Using Financial Statements
  - Ratios are not very helpful by themselves: they need to be compared to something
    - Look at other ratios, industry standard, etc.
  - Time-Trend Analysis
    - Used to see how the firm's performance is changing through time
  - Peer Group Analysis
    - Compare to similar companies or within industries
- Financial Planning
  - May be motivated by need to match/exceed competitor's growth rate in order to maintain position in industry
  - Determine your objective growth (of sales)
  - Mostly market conditions along with your operational and financial capabilities will be instrumental
  - Determine what increase you need in your assets to achieve your growth
  - Figure out the funding for your extra assets
  - Pro Forma = projected



## Lecture 8: Pro Forma Statement Analysis

- Percentage of sales approach - model organic accounts as increasing in proportion to sales 

- $$
  \text{EFN}=(\frac{\text{Assets}}{\text{Sales}})\times\Delta\text{Sales}-\frac{\text{Spon. Liab.}}{\text{Sales}}\times\Delta\text{Sales}-(PM\times\text{Projected Sales})\times(1-d)
  $$

- Growth rates

  - Internal growth rate
  - Sustainable growth rate



## Lecture 9: Cash Flow Valuation

- Negative EFN => surplus

- Money coming into equity must either increase assets or reduce liabilities

- The Internal Growth Rate

  - The internal growth rate tells us how much the company can grow assets using retained earnings as the only source of financing

  - $$
    \text{Internal Growth Rate}=\frac{\text{ROA}\times b}{1-\text{ROA}\times b}
    $$

  - Higher than IGR => higher debt-equity ratio

- The Sustainable Growth Rate

  - The sustainable growth rate tells us how much the firm can grow by using internally generated funds and issuing debt to maintain a constant debt ratio

  - $$
    \text{Sustainable Growth Rate}=\frac{\text{ROE}\times b}{1-\text{ROE}\times b}
    $$

- The One-Period Case

  - If you were to invest $10,000 at 5% interest for one year, your investment would grow to $10,500
    - $500 would be interest
    - $10,000 is the principal payment/present value
    - $10,500 is the total due/future value

- Future Value

- In the one-period case, the formula for FV can be written as:

  - $$
    \text{FV}=C_0\times(1+r)
    $$



## Lecture 10: Net Present Value

- Net Present Value

  - In the one-period case, the formula for NPV can be written as:
  
    - $$
      \text{NPV}=-\text{Cost}+\text{PV}
      $$
  
  - Use to compare options that occur over different periods of time by reducing their scope to a single period
  
- The Multi-Period Case

  - The general formula for the future value of an investment over many periods can be written as:

    - $$
      FV=C_0\times(1+r)^T
      $$

      - `C_0` is cash flow at date `0`
      - `r` is the appropriate interest rate
      - `T` is the number of periods over which the cash is invested

  - Markets shift as the interest rates move and firms readjust based on new NPVs

- Effect of Interest Rate on Tail-Heavy Cash Flows

  - Tail-heavy cash flows' NPV fall faster when interest rates increase
  - Interest rate changes affect different cash flows in different ways




## Lecture 11: NPV Analysis

- Each project needs to be brought to the same time period in order to compare them

  - If PV < Cost, don't purchase

- NPV = 0 at the market rate, NPV only accounts for what you make over the market

- Compounding Periods

  - Compounding an investment `m` times a year for `T` years provides for future value of wealth:

    - $$
      FV=C_0\times\left(1+\frac{r}{m}\right)^{m\times T}
      $$

- Effective Annual Rates of interest

  - A reasonable question is "what is the effective annual rate of interest on that investment?"
  - The Effective Annual Rate (EAR) of interest is the annual rate that would give us the same end-of-investment wealth

- Simplifications

  - Perpetuity

    - A constant stream of cash flows that lasts forever

    - $$
      PV=\frac{C}{(1+r)}+\frac{C}{(1+r)^2}+\frac{C}{(1+r)^3}+\ ...\ =\frac{C}{r}
      $$

      

  - Growing perpetuity

    - A stream of cash flows that grows at a constant rate forever

    - $$
      PV=\frac{C}{(1+r)}+\frac{C\times(1+g)}{(1+r)^2}+\frac{C\times(1+g)^2}{(1+r)^3}+\ ...\ = \frac{C}{r-g}
      $$

  - Annuity

    - A stream of constant cash flows that lasts for a fixed number of periods

    - $$
      PV=\frac{C}{r}\left(1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^T}\right)
      $$

  - Growing annuity

    - A stream of cash flows that grows at a constant rate for a fixed number of periods



## Lecture 12:

## Reading 1: Introduction to Corporate Finance

- What is Corporate Finance?
  - In starting a firm, you make in investment in assets like inventory, machinery, land, and labor while matching that investment with cash raised through financing => basis of value creation
  - The Balance Sheet Model of the Firm
    - Financial snapshot of the firm and its activities at a single point in time
    - Assets of the firm located on the LHS of the balance sheet
      - Separated into current and fixed
        - Fixed assets are those that last a long time
          - Some fixed assets are tangible, like machinery and equipment
          - Some fixed assets are intangible, like patents and trademarks
        - Current assets have short lives, like inventory
    - Forms of financing are located on the RHS of the balance sheet
      - Firms issue debt (loan agreements) or equity shares (stock certificates)
      - Liabilities also classified as long or short-lived
        - Short-term debts are current liabilities, loans and other obligations that must be repaid in 1 year
        - Long-term debts are debts that do not have to be repaid in 1 year
      - Shareholders' equity represents the difference between the value of the assets and the debt of the firm
        - It is a residual claim of the firm's assets
    - Finance is a study of the following 3 questions:
      - What long-lived assets should the firm invest? (LHS)
        - Capital budgeting => the process of making and managing expenditures on long-lived assets
      - How can the firm raise cash for required capital expenditures? (RHS)
        - Capital structure => represents the proportions of the firm's financing from current and long-term debt and equity
      - How should short-term operating cash flows be managed? (Upper)
        - Uncertainty/mismatch of cash inflows and outflows
          - Source of cash-flow problems
        - Net working capital => current assets minus current liabilities
  - The Financial Manager
    - Finance activity usually associated with a top officer (VP/CFO)
    - Treasurer and controller report to the CFO
      - Treasurer responsible for handling cash flows, managing capital expenditure decisions, and making financial plans
      - Controller handles the accounting function (taxes, cost, and financial accounting) and information systems
- The Corporate Firm
  - Firm is a way of organizing the economic activity of many individuals
  - Basic problem of the firm is how to raise cash
    - Standard method is the corporate form of business - organizing the firm as a corporation
  - The Sole Proprietorship
    - **Sole proprietorship** - business owned by 1 person
      - The sole proprietorship is the cheapest business to form
        - No formal chapter required
        - Few government regulations must be satisfied
      - Sole proprietorship pays no corporate income taxes
        - All profits taxed as individual income
      - The sole proprietorship has unlimited liability for business debts and obligations
        - No distinction is made between personal and business assets
      - The life of the sole proprietorship is limited by the life of the sole proprietor
      - Equity money that can be raised by the sole proprietor is limited to the proprietor's personal wealth
  - The Partnership
    - **Partnership** - 2+ people get together
    - 2 types of partnerships: general and limited
      - **General partnership** - all partners agree to provide some fraction of the work and cash and to share the profits and losses
        - Each partner is liable for all of the debts of the partnership
        - Agreement may be formal or oral
      - **Limited partnership** - permits liability of some of the partners to be limited to the amount of cash each contributed to the partnership
        - At least 1 partner is a general partner
        - The limited partners do no participate in managing the business
    - Partnerships are usually inexpensive/easy to form
      - Written documents required for complicated agreements
      - Business licenses and filing fees may be necessary
    - General partners have unlimited liability for all debts
      - If 1 general partner is unable to meet his/her commitment, the shortfall must be made up for by the other partners
    - The general partnership is terminated when a general partner dies or withdraws
      - Difficult for a partnership to transfer ownership without dissolving
      - Limited partners may sell their interest in a business
    - Difficult for a partnership to raise large amounts of cash
      - Equity contributions are usually limited to a partner’s ability and desire to contribute to the partnership
    - Income from a partnership is taxed as personal income to the partners
    - Management control resides with the general partners
      - Usually a majority vote is required on important matters, such as the amount of profit to be retained in the business
  - The Corporation
    - **Corporation** - distinct legal entity
      - Can have a name and enjoy legal powers of natural persons
      - More complicated to start than proprietorships or partnerships
        - Incorporators must prepare articles of incorporation and a set of bylaws
          - Name of the corporation
          - Intended life of the corporation
          - Business purpose
          - Number of shares of stock that the corporation is authorized to issue, with a statement of limitations and rights of different classes of shares
          - Nature of the rights granted to shareholders
          - Number of members of the initial board of directors
          - Bylaws are rules to be used by the corporation to regulate its own existence
      - Comprises 3 sets of distinct interests: shareholders, directors, and corporation officers
        - Shareholders control corporation's direction, policies, and activities
          - They elect a board of directors who appoint top management
        - Top management manage the operations of the corporation in the best interest of the shareholders
        - May be large overlap in smaller corporations
      - Ownership can be readily transferred to new owners
        - No limit to the transferability of shares
      - Corporation has unlimited life
        - Separate from owners, death/withdrawal doesn't affect the legal existence of the corporation
      - Shareholders' liability limited to the amount invested in the ownership shares
      - Major advantages: limited liability, ease of ownership transfer, and perpetual succession
      - Major disadvantage: federal government taxes corporate income
        - In addition to other taxes that shareholders pay
    - Creation of new business organization: LLC (limited liability company)
      - Goal is to operate/be taxed like a partnership by retain limited liability for owners
      - IRS can treat LLCs as corporations unless they meet given criteria
      - Popular amongst large accounting firms and law firms
  - A Corporation by Another Name...
    - Variations of the corporate form of organization include joint stock companies, public limited companies, or limited liability companies
- The Importance of Cash Flows
  - Most important job of a financial manager is to create value from the firm’s capital budgeting, financing, and net working capital activities
    - Try to buy assets that generate more cash than they cost
    - Sell bonds and stocks and other financial instruments that raise more cash than they cost
    - In essence, the firm must create more cash flow than it uses
      - Cash flows paid to bondholders and stockholders of the firm should be greater than the cash flows they put into the firm
  - Identification of Cash Flows
    - Sometimes not easy to identify cash flows
    - Much of the information we obtain is within accounting statements
      - Extraction of cash flow information from these statements is the work of financial analysis
  - Timing of Cash Flows
    - The value of an investment made by a firm depends on the timing of cash flows
    - Individuals prefer to receive cash flows earlier rather than later
  - Risk of Cash Flows
    - The amount and timing of cash flows are not usually known with certainty
    - Most investors have an aversion to risk
- The Goal of Financial Management
  - The goal of financial management is to make money or add value for the owners
  - Possible Goals
    - Survive
    - Avoid financial distress and bankruptcy
    - Beat the competition
    - Maximize sales or market share
    - Minimize costs
    - Maximize profits
    - Maintain steady earnings growth
    - These are not precise, presents problems as a goal for the financial manager
    - Goals tend to fall into 2 classes
      - Profitability - earning or increasing profits
        - Sales, market share, cost control
      - Controlling risk 
        - Bankruptcy avoidance, stability, and safety
      - Tend to be contradictory, need a goal that encompasses both factors
  - The Goal of Financial Management
    - What is a good financial management decision?
      - Good decisions increase the value of the stock, and poor decisions decrease the value of the stock
    - Goal: maximize the current value per share of the existing stock
      - No ambiguity, no short-run vs. long-run debate
      - Since stockholders are paid after everyone else, if they're winning, so is everyone else
  - A More General Goal
    - What is the appropriate goal when the firm has no traded stock
    - More general goal: maximize the value of the existing owners' equity
      - Doesn't include illegal/unethical action
      - Financial manager best serves the owners of the business by identifying goods and services that add value to the firm because they are desired and valued in the free marketplace
- The Agency Problem and Control of the Corporation
  - In large corporations, ownership can be spread over a huge number of stockholders
    - Management effectively controls the firm
    - Will management pursue its own goals at the stockholders' expense?
  - Agency Relationships
    - **Agency relationship** - the relationship between stockholders and management
      - Possibility for a conflict of interest between the principal (hirer) and the agent (hired) - **agency problem**
        - May be affected by method of compensation
  - Management Goals
    - **Agency cost** - the costs of the conflict of interest between stockholders and management
      - Can be indirect or direct
        - Indirect costs include lost opportunities
        - Direct costs come in 2 forms
          - Corporate expenditure that benefits management but costs the stockholders
          - Expense that arises from the need to monitor management actions
    - Left to themselves, managers would tend to maximize the amount of resources over which have control (corporate power/wealth)
      - Could lead to overemphasis on corporate size or growth
  - Do Managers Act in the Stockholders' Interests?
    - Depends on 2 factors:
      - How closely are management goals aligned with stockholder goals?
        - Partially dependent on manner of compensation
      - Can managers be replaced if they do not pursue stockholder goals?
    - Managerial Compensation
      - Management will frequently have a significant economic incentive to increase share value for two reasons:
        - Managerial compensation is usually tied to financial performance in general and share value in particular
          - Able to buy stock at a bargain price => leads to dependence on increasing stockholders' value
        - Job prospects
          - Better performers in the firm will get promoted
          - Managers who are more successful in pursuing stockholder goals will be in greater demand in the labor market => they command larger salaries
    - Control of the Firm
      - Ultimately rests with stockholders => they elect directors who hire and fire management
      - **Proxy fight** - valuable mechanism by which a group solicits proxies to replace the existing board and thereby replace existing management
        - **Proxy** - the authority to vote someone else's stock
      - Firms that are poorly managed are more vulnerable to takeover
        - Greater profit potential exists
    - Stockholders control the firm and stockholder wealth maximization is the relevant goal of the corporation
      - Management goals may still be pursued at the expense of the stockholders

## Reading 2: Financial Statements and Cash Flow

- The Balance Sheet
  - **Balance sheet** - an accountant's snapshot of a firm's accounting value on a particular date
    - 2 sides: assets on the LHS and liabilities/stockholder's equity on the RHS
    - `Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' equity`
      - Must always hold, by definition
      - Stockholders' equity is defined to be the difference between assets and the liabilities of the firm
        - Equity is what the stockholders are left with after the firm has satisfied its obligations
    - 3 concerns: liquidity, debt vs. equity, and value vs. cost
  - Liquidity
    - **Liquidity** - the ease and quickness with which assets can be converted to cash (without significant loss in value)
      - **Current assets** - cash and assets that can be turned into cash within a year
        - Most liquid
      - **Accounts receivable** - amounts not yet collected from customers for goods or services sold to them
      - **Inventory** - composed of raw materials to be used in production, work in process, and finished goods
      - **Fixed assets**
        - Least liquid kind of assets
        - Tangible fixed assets include property, plant, and equipment
        - Intangible fixed assets include trademarks and patents
        - Do not convert to cash from normal business activity, not usually used to pay expenses such as payroll
      - More liquid assets translate to easier time meeting short-term obligations
        - Probability that a firm will avoid financial distress can be linked to its liquidity
        - Liquid assets have lower rates of return than fixed assets
        - Sacrifice liquidity for profit
  - Debt vs. Equity
    - **Liabilities** - obligations of the firm that require a payout within a stipulated period
      - Many involve contractual obligations to repay a stated amount and interest over a period
      - Frequently associated with nominally fixed cash burdens  (**debt service**) that put the firm in default of a contract if not paid
    - **Stockholders' equity** - claim against the firm's assets that is residual and not fixed
      - Accounting value increases when retained earnings are added
  - Value vs. Cost
    - **Carrying value**/**book value** - the accounting value of a firm's assets
    - Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), audited financial statements of firms in the US carry assets at cost
    - **Market value** - price at which buyers and sellers would trade the assets
      - Coincidence if accounting value and market value were the same
      - Management's job is to create value for the firm that exceeds its cost
- The Income Statement
  - **Income Statement** - measures performance over a specific period
  - `Revenue - Expenses = Income`
  - Balance sheet is a snapshot, the income statement is a video recording of what happened between 2 snapshots
  - Several sections:
    - Operations section reports the firm's revenues and expenses from principal operations
      - EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes)
    - Non-operating section includes all financing costs, such as interest expense
      - Second section reports as a separate item the amount of taxes levied on income
    - Last item is the bottom line - net income
      - Expressed per share of common stock (earnings per share)
  - Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
    - Revenue is recognized on an income statement when the earnings process is virtually completed and an exchange of goods or services has occurred
      - Unrealized appreciation from owning property will not be recognized as income
        - Allows for a device to smooth income
    - Matching principle of GAAP dictates that revenues be matched with expenses
      - Income is reported when it is earned, regardless of if cash flow occurred
  - Noncash Items
    - **Noncash items** - expenses against revenues that do not affect cash flow
    - **Depreciation** - reflection of the accountant's estimate of the cost of equipment used up in the production process
      - Cost must be used up over the useful life of the asset
    - **Deferred taxes** - result from difference between accounting income and true taxable income
      - Not a cash outflow, but shows up on the balance sheet as deferred tax liability
      - Theory is that if taxable income is less than accounting income in the current year, it will be more than accounting income later on
    - Difference between cash flows and accounting income can be quite dramatic
  - Time and Costs
    - Visualize future time as having the short-run and the long-run
      - **Short-run** - period in which certain equipment, resources, and commitments of the firm are fixed
        - Long enough time to vary outputs
        - Decisions in the short-run have fixed costs (costs that don't change due to fixed commitments)
          - Bond interest, overhead, property taxes, etc.
        - Costs that aren't fixed are variable => change as the output of the firm changes
          - Raw materials, wages, etc.
      - **Long-run** - all costs are variable
        - Distinguishes product costs from period costs
          - **Product cost** - total production costs incurred during a period and are reported on the income statement as cost of goods sold
          - **Period cost** - costs that are allocated to a time period
            - Selling, general, and administrative expenses
- Taxes
  - Can be one of the largest cash outflows a firm experiences
  - Size of a firm's tax bill is determined by the tax code
    - Result of political, not economic forces
  - Corporate Tax Rates
    - Corporate tax rates are not strictly increasing
      - Instituted by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
    - Only 4 corporate rates according to the originators of the current tax rules
      - 15%, 25%, 34%, and 35%
      - 38% and 39% brackets arise due to surcharges applied to the 34% and 35% rates => really 6 corporate tax brackets
  - Average vs. Marginal Tax Rates
    - **Average tax rate** - tax bill divided by your taxable income
      - The percentage of your income that goes to pay taxes
    - **Marginal tax rate** - the tax you would pay if you earned 1 more dollar
      - Tells us the marginal effect of a decision on our tax bill
    - **Flat-rate tax** - there is only 1 tax rate, so the rate is the same for all income levels
      - Marginal tax == average tax rate
      - US uses a modified flat-rate tax that becomes a true flat-rate tax at high incomes
    - Under current tax law, average tax rates never go down despite marginal tax rates decreasing
    - Average/marginal tax rates are 35% => federal
- Net Working Capital
  - `NWC = Current Assets - Current Liabilities`
  - **Change in net working capital** - a firm can invest in NWC
    - Usually positive in a growing firm



## Reading 3: Financial Statements Analysis and Financial Models

- Financial Statements Analysis

  - Financial statements and the numbers derived from them are the primary means of communicating financial information both within the firm and outside the firm
  - One important goal of the accountant is to report financial information to the user in a form useful for decision making
  - Standardizing Statements
    - One thing we want to do with a company's financial statements is to compare them to those of other, similar companies
      - Almost impossible to perform a direct comparison due to differences in size
      - May even have to deal with size and currency differences
    - Standardize by working with percentages rather than dollars
      - Resulting statements are called **common-size statements**
  - Common-Size Balance Sheets
    - Total change must be zero since the beginning and ending numbers must add up to `100%`
    - In this form, financial statements are relatively easy to read and compare
  - Common-Size Income Statements
    - Net income - the bottom line, defined as total revenue minus total expenses
      - Reflects differences in a firm's capital structure and taxes as well as operating income
      - Interest expense and taxes are subtracted from operating income in computing net income
      - Shareholders look closely at net income because dividend payout and retained earnings are closely related to net income
    - **EPS** - net income divided by the number of shares outstanding
      - Net income expressed on a per share basis
    - **EBIT** - earnings before interest expense and taxes
      - Income before unusual items, discontinued operating or extraordinary items
      - Operating expenses are subtracted from total operations revenues
    - **EBITDA** - earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
      - `EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation and amortization`
        - Amortization refers to a noncash expense similar to depreciation except it applies to an intangible asset, rather than a tangible asset
    - Tells us what happens to each dollar in sales
    - Can give interesting information for comparisons

- Ratio Analysis

  - **Financial ratios** - ways of comparing and investigating the relationships between different pieces of financial information

  - Problem: people and sources don't necessarily compute them in exactly the same way, which leads to confusion

  - Questions:

    - How is it computed?
    - What is it intended to measure, and why might we be interest?
    - What is the unit of measurement?
    - What might a high or low value be telling us? How might such values be misleading?
    - How could this measure be improved?

  - Categories:

    - Short-term solvency/liquidity ratios
    - Long-term solvency/financial leverage ratios
    - Asset management/turnover ratios
    - Profitability ratios
    - Market value ratios

  - **Short-Term Solvency or Liquidity Measures**

    - Provide information about a firm's liquidity

      - Ability of the firm to pay its bills over the short run without undue stress
      - Focus on current assets and current liabilities

    - Particularly interesting to short-term creditors

    - Book values and market values likely to be similar, but current assets/liabilities change fairly rapidly

      - Today's amounts may not be a reliable indicator for future success

    - **Current Ratio**

      - $$
        \text{Current ratio}=\frac{\text{Current assets}}{\text{Current liabilities}}
        $$

      - Measure of short-term liquidity

      - Unit of measurement of either dollars or times

        - `$1.31` in current assets for every `$1` of current liabilities
        - Current liabilities are covered `1.31 times` over

      - Higher current ratio = better for creditors = indicates liquidity + inefficient use of cash/short-term assets to the firm

      - Current ratio should be `>1`, `<1` indicates that NWC is negative, which is highly unusual for healthy firms

        - An apparently low current ratio may not be a bad sign for a company with a large reserve of untapped borrowing power

    - **Quick (or Acid-Test) Ratio**

      - Inventory is the least liquid current asset

        - Book values are least reliable because quality of inventory isn't considered

      - Large inventories are a sign of short-term struggle

        - Overestimated sales => overbuying or overproducing
        - Large portion of liquidity tied up in slow-moving inventory

      - $$
        \text{Quick ratio}=\frac{\text{Current assets}-\text{Inventory}}{\text{Current liabilities}}
        $$

      - Using cash to buy inventory doesn't affect the current ratio, but it lowers the quick ratio

        - Reflects the illiquidity of inventory compared to cash

    - **Cash Ratio**

      - $$
        \text{Cash ratio}=\frac{\text{Cash}}{\text{Current liabilities}}
        $$

      - May be interesting to very short-term creditors

  - **Long-Term Solvency Measures**

    - Sometimes called **financial leverage ratios** or **just leverage ratios**

    - Address the firm's long-run ability to meet its obligations/its financial leverage

    - **Total Debt Ratio**

      - Takes into account all debts of all maturities to all creditors

      - $$
        \text{Total debt ratio}=\frac{\text{Total assets}-\text{Total equity}}{\text{Total assets}}
        $$

      - Two useful variations:

        - $$
          \text{Debt-equity ratio}=\frac{\text{Total debt}}{\text{Total equity}}
          $$

        - $$
          \text{Equity multiplier}=\frac{\text{Total assets}}{\text{Total equity}}
          $$

          - Is `1` plus the debt-equity ratio

        - Any one of the three ratios can be used to calculate the other two

    - **Times Interest Earned**

      - $$
        \text{Times interest earned ratio}=\frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest}}
        $$

      - Measures how well a company has its interest obligations covered

      - Often called the interest coverage ratio

    - **Cash Coverage**

      - Problem with TIE is that it's based on EBIT, which isn't an accurate representation of cash available to pay interest

      - $$
        \text{Cash coverage ratio}=\frac{\text{EBIT}+(\text{Depreciation and amortization})}{\text{Interest}}
        $$

        - Numerator is EBITDA => a measure frequently used to measure cash flow available to meet financial obligations

  - **Asset Management or Turnover Measures**

    - Sometimes called **asset management** or **utilization ratios**

    - Can all be interpreted as measures of turnover => how efficiently a firm uses its assets to generate sales

    - **Inventory Turnover and Days' Sales in Inventory**

      - Measures how fast a firm sells products

      - $$
        \text{Inventory turnover}=\frac{\text{Cost of goods sold}}{\text{Inventory}}
        $$

      - Higher this ratio, the more efficiently we are managing inventory

      - Can be used to figure out how long it took to turnover the inventory on average:

        - $$
          \text{Days' sales in inventory}=\frac{365\ \text{days}}{\text{Inventory turnover}}
          $$

    - **Receivables Turnover and Days' Sales in Receivables**

      - Measures how fast a firm collects on its sales

      - $$
        \text{Receivables turnover}=\frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Accounts Receivable}}
        $$

      - $$
        \text{Days' sales in receivables}=\frac{365\ \text{days}}{\text{Receivables turnover}}
        $$

        - Frequently called the average collection period (ACP)

    - **Total Asset Turnover**

      - 
        $$
        \text{Total asset turnover}=\frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Total assets}}
        $$

  - **Profitability Measures**

    - Measure how efficiently a firm uses its assets and how efficiently the firm manages its operations

    - **Profit Margin**

      - $$
        \text{Profit margin}=\frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Sales}}
        $$

    - **EBITDA Margin**

      - Looks more directly at operating cash flows than net income

      - Doesn't include the effect of capital structure or taxes

      - $$
        \text{EBITDA margin}=\frac{\text{EBITDA}}{\text{Sales}}
        $$

      - High margin => low expense ratios relative to sales

    - **Return on Assets**

      - Measure of profit per dollar of assets

      - $$
        \text{Return on assets}=\frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Total assets}}
        $$

    - **Return on Equity**

      - Measure of how the stockholders fared during the year

      - Generally, the bottom-line measure of performance

      - $$
        \text{Return on equity}=\frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Total equity}}
        $$

      - ROA and ROE are accounting terms => based on book assets/equity

  - **Market Value Measures**

    - Based on information not necessarily contained in financial statements => the market price per share of the stock

      - Can be calculated directly only for publicly traded companies

    - **Price-Earnings Ratio**

      - $$
        \text{PE ratio}=\frac{\text{Price per share}}{\text{Earnings per share}}
        $$

      - Measures how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of current earnings

      - High PEs interpreted as having significant prospect for future growth

    - **Market-to-Book Ratio**

      - $$
        \text{Market-to-book ratio}=\frac{\text{Market value per share}}{\text{Book value per share}}
        $$

      - Market-to-book ratio compares the market value of the firm's investments to their cost
        
      - `<1` may mean that the firm has been unsuccessful in creating value for stockholders
    
    - **Market Capitalization**
      - $$
        \text{Market capitalization}=\text{Market price per share}\times\text{Number of shares outstanding}
        $$
    
  - **Enterprise Value**
    
      - $$
        \text{EV}=\text{Market capitalization}+\text{Market value of interest bearing debt}-\text{cash}
        $$
      
    - Purpose is to better estimate how much it would take to buy all the outstanding stock of a firm and also pay off debts
    
      - Cash adjustment recognizes that the cash would be used to help pay off said debt
    
  - **Enterprise Value Multiples**
    
      - $$
        \text{EV multiples}=\frac{\text{EV}}{\text{EBITDA}}
        $$
      
    - Allows comparison of firms when they have differing capital structures (interest expense), taxes, or capital spending
    
      - Expect firms with high growth opportunities to have high EV multiples

- The Du Pont Identity

  - Difference between ROA and ROE reflects the use of debt financing or financial leverage

  - A Closer Look at ROE

    - $$
      \text{ROE}=\frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Total equity}}\\\text{ROE}=\frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Total equity}}\times\frac{\text{Assets}}{\text{Assets}}\\\text{ROE}=\frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Assets}}\times\frac{\text{Assets}}{\text{Total equity}}\\\text{ROE}=\text{ROA}\times\text{Equity multiplier}
      $$

    - $$
      \text{ROE}=\frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Sales}}\times\frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Assets}}\times\frac{\text{Assets}}{\text{Total equity}}\\\text{ROE}=\frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Sales}}\times\frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Assets}}\times\frac{\text{Assets}}{\text{Total equity}}\\\text{ROE}=\text{Profit margin}\times\text{Total asset turnover}\times\text{Equity multiplier}
      $$

      - The **Du Pont identity** => partitions ROA into its two component parts
        - Tells us that ROE is affected by three things:
          - Operating efficiency (profit margin)
          - Asset use efficiency (total asset turnover)
          - Financial leverage (equity multiplier)
        - Tells us how to correct unsatisfactory ROEs

  - Problems with Financial Statement Analysis

    - Basic problem with financial statement analysis is that there's no underlying theory to identify which quantities to look at and establish benchmarks
    - Peer group analysis only works for firms that are strictly in the same line of business, in a competitive industry, and there's only one way of operating
    - Major competitors and peer group members may operate in different countries, meaning their financial statements don't necessarily conform to GAAP
    - Different firms use different accounting procedures
    - Different firms end fiscal years at different times
    - Unusual or transient events may affect financial performance, leading to misleading signals

- Financial Models

  - Models output pro forma financial statements

    - Pro forma - "as a matter of form"

  - Financial statements are the form we use to summarize the projected future financial status of a company

  - The Percentage of Sales Approach

    - Basic idea: separate the income statement and balance sheet accounts into two groups

      - Those that vary with sales
      - Those that don't
      - Given a sales forecast, we can then calculate how much financing the firm will need to support the predicted sales level

    - **Percentage of sales approach** => goal is to develop a quick and practical way of generating pro forma statements

    - The Income Statement

      - Assume that profit margin is constant => costs are a constant percentage of sales

      - **Dividend payout ratio**

        - $$
          \text{Dividend payout ratio}=\frac{\text{Cash dividends}}{\text{Net income}}
          $$

      - **Retention ratio** or **Plowback ratio**

        - $$
          \text{Retention ratio}=\frac{\text{Addition to retained earnings}}{\text{Net income}}
          $$

          - Equal to `1` minus the dividend payout ratio => everything not paid out is retained

    - The Balance Sheet

      - Assume that some items vary directly with sales and other do not

        - For items that vary with sales, we express each as a percentage of sales for the year just completed
        - When an item doesn't vary directly with sales, we write `n/a`

      - **Capital intensity ratio** - the ratio of total assets to sales

        - Tells us the amount of assets needed to generate $1 in sales
        - Higher capital intensity ratio => more capital intensive firm
        - Is just the reciprocal of the total asset turnover ratio

      - **External financing needed**

        - $$
          \text{EFN}=\frac{\text{Assets}}{\text{Sales}}\times\Delta\text{Sales}-\frac{\text{Spontaneous liabilities}}{\text{Sales}}\times\Delta\text{Sales}-\text{PM}\times\text{Projected sales}\times(1-d)
          $$

          - `ΔSales` is the projected change in sales
          - `Spontaneous liabilities` are liabilities that naturally move up and down with sales
          - `PM` is the profit margin
          - `d` is the dividend payout ratio
          - 3 parts:
            - Projected increase in assets (capital intensity ratio)
            - Spontaneous increase in liabilities
            - Projected net income times the retention ratio (projected addition to retained earnings)

- External Financing and Growth

  - The higher the rate of growth in sales or assets, the greater will be the need for external financing

  - Financial Policy and Growth

    - **Internal Growth Rate** - the maximum growth rate that can be achieved with no external financing of any kind

      - The required increase in assets is exactly equal to the addition to retained earnings => EFN is zero

      - $$
        \text{Internal growth rate}=\frac{\text{ROA}\times b}{1-\text{ROA}\times b}
        $$

        - `b` is the retention ratio

    - **The Sustainable Growth Rate** - the maximum growth rate a firm can achieve with no external equity financing while it maintains a constant debt-equity ratio (without increasing its financial leverage)

      - $$
        \text{Sustainable growth rate}=\frac{\text{ROE}\times b}{1-\text{ROE}\times b}
        $$

        - Identical to internal growth rate, except ROE is used in place of ROA

    - Determinants of Growth 

      - Due to the role ROE plays in the determination of the sustainable growth rate, the factors that determine ROE are important determinants of growth

        - $$
          \text{ROE}=\text{Profit margin}\times\text{Total asset turnover}\times\text{Equity multiplier}
          $$

      - Firm's ability to sustain growth depends explicitly on four factors:

        - Profit margin => increase in profit margin increases the firm's ability to generate funds internally
        - Dividend policy => decrease in percentage of net income paid out as dividends will increase the retention ratio, increasing internally generated equity
        - Financial policy => increase in the debt-equity ratio increases the firm's financial leverage, making additional debt financing available
        - Total asset turnover => increase in total asset turnover increases the sales generated for each dollar in assets, decreasing the firm's need for new assets as sales grow
          - Same as decreasing capital intensity

      - The sustainable growth rate illustrates the explicit relationship between the firm's operating efficiency as measured by profit margin, asset use efficiency as measured by total asset turnover, dividend policy as measure by the retention ratio, and financial policy as measured by the debt-equity ratio

    - Profit Margins and Sustainable Growth

      - If a firm does not wish to sell new equity and its profit margin, dividend policy, financial policy, and total asset turnover are all fixed, then there is only one possible growth ratio
      - Financial planning ensures internal consistency among the firm's various goals
        - Captured by the sustainable growth rate



## Reading 4: Discounted Cash Flow Valuation

- Valuation: The One-Period Case

  - **Future value** or **compound value** - the value of a sum after investing over one or more periods

  - **Present value** - the amount of money required to be invested to get a specific return in the future

    - $$
      \text{PV}=\frac{C_1}{1+r}
      $$

      - `C_1` is cash flow at date `1` and `r` is the rate of return (**discount rate**)

    - Present value analysis tells us the present value of a future payment

  - Future and present value analysis always lead to the same decision

  - Financial analysts frequently want to determine the exact cost or benefit of a decision

    - $$
      \text{NPV}=-\text{Cost}+\text{PV}
      $$

    - **Net present value** is the present value of future cash flows minus the present value of the cost of the investment

  - Any example with risk poses a more complex problem than a riskless one

    - More risk => higher discount rate

- The Multiperiod Case

  - Future Value and Compounding

    - **Compounding** - the process of leaving money in the financial market and lending it for another year

      - **Simple interest** - Interest times a constant
        - Interest is not reinvested
      - **Interest of interest** - Exponential interest that results from compounding
        - Cash is invested at **compound interest** - each interest payment is reinvested

    - $$
      \text{FV}=C_0\times(1+r)^\mathcal{T}
      $$

      - `C_0` is the cash to be invested today, `r` is the interest rate per period, and `T` is the number of periods over which the cash is invested

  - Present Value and Discounting

    - **Discounting** - calculating the present value of a future cash flow

      - Opposite of compounding

    - **Present value factor** - the factor used to calculate the present value of a future cash flow

    - $$
      \text{PV}=\frac{C_\mathcal{T}}{(1+r)^\mathcal{T}}
      $$

      - `C_T` is the cash flow at date `T` and `r` is the appropriate discount rate

  - Finding the Number of Periods

    - Finding the answer involves solving for the last variable in the basic present value equation, the number of periods

  - The Algebraic Formula

    - Present value of receiving a cash flow one year from now is:

      - $$
        \text{PV}=\frac{C_1}{1+r}
        $$

    - Present value of receiving a cash flow two years from now is:

      - $$
        \text{PV}=\frac{C_2}{(1+r)^2}
        $$

    - NPV of a `T`-period project is:

      - $$
        \text{NPV}=-C_0+\frac{C_1}{1+r}+\frac{C_2}{(1+r)^2}+\ ...\ +\frac{C_\mathcal{T}}{(1+r)^\mathcal{T}}=-C_0+\sum^\mathcal{T}_{i=1}\frac{C_i}{(1+r)^i}
        $$

        - Initial flow, `C_0` is assumed to be negative because it represents an investment

- Compounding Periods

  - Sometimes, compounding may occur more frequently than just once a year

  - Compounding an investment `m` times a year provides end-of-year wealth of:

    - $$
      C_o\left(1+\frac{r}{m}\right)^m
      $$

      - `C_0` is the initial investment and `r` is the **stated annual interest rate** or **annual percentage rate (APR)**

    - The annual rate of return is called the **effective annual rate (EAR)** or the **effective annual yield (EAY)**

      - $$
        \text{EAR}=\left(1+\frac{r}{m}\right)^m-1
        $$

  - Distinction between Stated Annual Interest Rate and Effective Annual Rate

    - SAIR becomes meaningful only if the compounding interval is given
    - EAR is meaningful without a compounding interval

  - Compounding over Many Years

    - Future value with compounding:

      - 
        $$
        \text{FV}=C_0\left(1+\frac{r}{m}\right)^{m\mathcal{T}}
        $$

  - Continuous Compounding

    - **Continuous compounding** - compounding every infinitesimal instant

    - Value at the end of `T` years is expressed as:

      - $$
        C_0\times e^{r\mathcal{T}}
        $$

        - `C_0` is the initial investment, `r` is the SAIR, and `T` is the number of years over which the investment runs

- Simplifications

  - Perpetuity

    - **Perpetuity** - a constant stream of cash flows without end

      - British consols - bonds that entitle the investor to yearly interest payments from the British government

        - Present value of the consol is the present value of all of its future coupons => give the investor `C` dollars per year

          - $$
            \text{PV}=\frac{C}{1+r}+\frac{C}{(1+r)^2}+\frac{C}{(1+r)^3}+\ ...\ =\frac{C}{r}
            $$

  - Growing Perpetuity

    - **Growing perpetuity** - cash flow stream that is assumed to rise indefinitely

      - $$
        \text{PV}=\frac{C}{1+r}+\frac{C\times(1+g)}{(1+r)^2}+\frac{C\times(1+g)^2}{(1+r)^3}+\ ...\ +\frac{C\times(1+g)^{\mathcal{N}-1}}{(1+r)^\mathcal{N}}=\frac{C}{r-g}
        $$

      - Three important points to consider:

        - The numerator - the cash flow one period hence, not at date `0`
        - The discount rate and the growth rate - the discount rate `r` must be greater than the growth rate `g` for the formula to work
          - PV undefined when `r < g`
        - The timing assumption - a regular and discrete pattern of cash flow is assumed

  - Annuity

    - **Annuity** - a level stream of regular payments that lasts for a fixed number of periods

      - $$
        \text{PV}=\frac{C}{1+r}+\frac{C}{(1+r)^2}+\frac{C}{(1+r)^3}+\ ...\ +\frac{C}{(1+r)^\mathcal{T}}
        $$

      - Present value of receiving the coupons for only `T` periods must be less than the present value of a consol

      - $$
        \text{PV}=\frac{C}{r}-\frac{C}{r}\left[\frac{1}{(1+r)^\mathcal{T}}\right]=C\left[\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{r(1+r)^\mathcal{T}}\right]=C\left[\frac{1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^\mathcal{T}}}{r}\right]
        $$

      - The term we use to compute the present value of the stream of level payments, `C`, for `T` years is called an **annuity factor**

        - $$
          A^\mathcal{T}_r
          $$

      - $$
        \text{FV}=C\left[\frac{(1+r)^\mathcal{T}}{r}-\frac1r\right]=C\left[\frac{(1+r)^\mathcal{T}-1}r\right]
        $$

      - Tricks:

        - Delayed annuity
          - Getting the timing right can be tricky
          - Especially true if the annuity or perpetuity begins at a date many periods in the future
          - Remember that the formula derives the present value of the annuity as of one period *prior* to the first payment
        - Annuity due
          - Formulas assume that the first annuity payment begins a full period hence - called an annuity in arrears or an ordinary annuity
          - Annuity with an immediate initial payment is called an annuity in advance or an annuity due
        - The infrequent annuity
          - An annuity with payments occurring less frequently than once a year
          - Determine the interest rate over the period => use the present value over that many periods
        - Equating present value of two annuities

  - Growing Annuity

    - **Growing annuity** - a finite number of growing cash flows

      - $$
        \text{PV}=C\left[\frac{1}{r-g}-\frac1{r-g}\times\left(\frac{1+g}{1+r}\right)^\mathcal{T}\right]=C\left[\frac{1-\left(\frac{1+g}{1+r}\right)^\mathcal{T}}{r-g}\right]
        $$

        - `C` is the payment to occur at the end of the first period, `r` is the interest rate, `g` is the rate of growth per period, and `T` is the number of periods for the annuity



## Reading 5: Net Present Value and Other Investment Rules

- Why Use Net Present Value?
  - Focus on capital budgeting, the decision-making process for accepting or rejecting projects
  - A dollar received in the future is worth less than a dollar received today, due to the potential investment value in the present
  - Basic investment rule (the **NPV Rule**) can be generalized to:
    - Accept a project if the NPV is greater than 0
    - Reject a project if NPV is less than zero
    - Accepting positive NPV projects benefits the stockholders
  - The value of the firm rises by the NPV of the project
  - **Value additivity** - the sum of the values of the different projects, divisions, or other entities within the firm
    - Implies that the contribution of any project to a firm's value is simply the NPV of the project
  - Future cash flows of real-world projects are invariably risky
    - Cash flows can only be estimated, not known
    - The discount rate on a risky project is the return that one can expect to earn on a financial asset of comparable risk
      - Often referred to as the opportunity cost
  - Three attributes of NPV:
    - NPV uses cash flows
      - Cash flows from a project can be used for other corporate purposes like dividend payments, other capital budgeting projects, or payments of corporate interest
      - On the other hand, earnings are an artificial construct and should not be used in capital budgeting because they don't represent cash
    - NPV uses all the cash flows of the project
      - Other approaches ignore cash flows beyond a particular date
    - NPV discounts the cash flows properly
      - Other approaches ignore the time value of money when handling cash flows
- The Payback Period Method
  - Defining the Rule
    - The amount of time it takes for the firm to recover its investment is the **payback period**
    - The **payback period rule** for making investment decisions involves selecting a cutoff date, and then evaluating if the payback period falls within that cutoff date
      - If it does, accept it
      - Otherwise, don't
  - Problems with the Payback Method
    - Timing of cash flows within the payback period
      - The payback method doesn't consider the timing of the cash flows within the payback period
      - NPV discounts the cash flows properly
    - Payments after the payback period
      - The payback method ignores all cash flows occurring after the payback period
      - Some valuable long-term projects are likely to be rejected
      - NPV uses all the cash flows of the project
    - Arbitrary standard for payback period
      - Choosing the payback cutoff date is somewhat arbitrary
      - Capital markets help estimate the discount rate used in the NPV method
  - Managerial Perspective
    - Often used by large, sophisticated companies when making relatively small decisions
    - It's easy to make decisions using payback
    - The short timespan means the company can evaluate the manager's decision quickly
    - May be used by firms with good investment opportunities but no available cash
      - Quick cash recovery increases the reinvestment possibilities for such firms
    - Pitfalls of payback may not be as applicable to the real-world as they are in hypothetical models
    - For big ticket decisions, payback is rarely used
  - Summary of Payback
    - Differs from NPV => is conceptually wrong
    - Can lead to foolish decisions if used too literally
    - Often used as a screen for decision-making due to its simplicity
- The Discounted Payback Period Method
  - **Discounted payback period method** - a variation of the payback method that first discounts the cash flows
  - Still has some of the major flaws of payback
  - if we've already discounted the cash flows, we may as well go all the way and use NPV
  - Really just a poor compromise between NPV and payback

- The Profitability Index

  - **Profitability index** - the ratio of the present value of the future expected cash flows after initial investment divided by the amount of initial investment

    - $$
      \text{PI}=\frac{\text{PV of cash flows subsequent to initial investment}}{\text{Initial investment}}
      $$

  - Application of the Profitability Index

    - Independent projects
      - According to the NPV rule, projects should be accepted if NPV is positive
      - PI is greater than `1` if the NPV is positive
      - The PI decision rule states that we accept an independent project if `PI > 1` and we reject it if `PI < 1`
    - Mutually exclusive projects
      - PI suffers from scale, ignoring the size of the initial investments
      - Can correct for this oversight using incremental analysis
    - Capital rationing
      - **Capital rationing** - the firm doesn't have enough capital to fund all positive NPV projects
      - In the case of limited funds, we cannot rank projects according to their NPVs, we should instead rank them according to the ratio of PV to initial investment => PI rule
      - PI cannot handle capital rationing over multiple time periods



## Reading 6: Making Capital Investment Decisions

- Incremental Cash Flows: The Key to Capital Budgeting
  - Cash Flows - Not Accounting Income
    - There is a big difference between corporate finance courses and financial accounting courses
      - Corporate finance use cash flows, while financial accounting stresses income or earnings numbers
      - When considering a single project, discount the cash flows, not earnings
      - When considering the firm as a whole, we discount dividends, not earnings, because dividends are the cash flows that an investor receives
    - Always discount cash flows, not earnings, when performing a capital budgeting calculation
      - Earnings do not represent real money, cash flows do
      - Only cash flows that are incremental to the project should be used => cash flows that occur as a direct consequence of accepting the project
  - Sunk Costs
    - A **sunk cost** is a cost that has already occurred
    - They cannot be changed by the decision to accept or reject the project => should be ignored, as they are not incremental cash outflows
  - Opportunity Costs
    - **Opportunity costs** - lost revenues that result from using assets in a project over other alternatives
      - Can be meaningfully viewed as a cost
      - Firm forgoes other opportunities for using the assets
  - Side Effects
    - Side effects are classified as either erosion or synergy
      - **Erosion** - occurs when a new product reduces the sales and, hence, the cash flows of existing products
      - **Synergy** - occurs when a new project increases the cash flows of existing projects
  - Allocated Costs
    - **Allocated cost** - viewed as a cash outflow of a project only if it is an incremental cost of the project
