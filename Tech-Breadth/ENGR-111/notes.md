## Lecture 1: Introduction to Finance

- Key Concepts and Skills
  - Know the basic types of financial management decisions and the role of the Financial Manager
  - Know the financial implications of the various forms of business organization
  - Know the goal of financial management
  - Understand the conflicts of interest that can arise between owners and managers
- What is Corporate Finance (or any kind of finance for that matter)?
  - Finance addresses the following 3 questions:
    - What long-term investments should the firm choose? - **capital budgeting**
      - I'm going to be producing things -> in order to produce these things, I need long-term investments
      - Ex) Dropbox needed servers (buy or rent?)
        - Buying is a long-term investment, renting is short-term
    - How should the firm raise funds for the selected investments? - **capital structure**
      - 2 major ways of financing - source determines the capital structure:
        - Debt - loans
          - Have to be paid back, no involvement in decision-making
        - Equity - the owner's money, friends, family, other investors, etc.
          - Include intellectually aligned people as the first investors
          - Doesn't have to be paid back, will be involved in decision-making
    - How should short-term assets be managed and financed? - **net working capital**
      - Refers to the difference between the funding of the company (capital structure) and the short-term buffer zone of assets
      - Dealing with day-to-day business
- What would you think about before investing in a company?
  - Need vs. want of product
    - If a product is a need, what do they bring to the table compared to competitors?
      - Account for **saturated markets**
  - Commitment of the CEO
    - Horse-jockey relationship: the CEO and the idea matter
  - Think about risk
    - Possible risk of the industry as a whole? (litigation, FDA, etc.)
    - Small companies (single points of failure, low margin of error)
  - How is the product distributed?
    - What **channels** are being used?
  - Many more factors must be taken into consideration
- **Balance sheets**
  - What does the company have?
    - **Asset** - anything the company owns (cash, equipment, etc.)
  - Looks at the company at one point in time
    - Like a picture of their finances at a single moment
    - Asks how much of it comes from capital budgeting, capital structure, and net working capital
  - LHS: total value of assets
    - **Current assets** - the assets that can be turned into cash in a short period of time (within 1 year)
      - Short-term assets
      - Liquid assets
      - Definition may change based on industry
    - **Fixed assets**
      - Long-term assets
      - Intangible vs. Tangible
  - RHS: total firm value to investors (sometimes found below LHS)
    - **Current liabilities** - short-term debt (must be paid within 1 year)
    - **Long-term debt**
    - **Shareholders' equity**
      - Money coming from owners
      - Money coming from within the company



## Lecture 2: The Balance Sheet

- Balance Sheet Model of the Firm

  - Tells us what the company has (assets) and what they owe (funds)
  - Must be provided to the public by law
  - RHS shows the source of the assets
    - Owner's own money => shareholders' equity
    - There's nothing left on the RHS, it just documents the source of the assets side
  - LHS and RHS should always be balanced
    - Money coming into the RHS is used to add to something on the LHS
    - Could put it into current assets as cash, buy equipment (fixed asset) etc.
    - When debt is paid off, it is subtracted from, the RHS

  - Fixed assets => what long-term assets should the firm choose? => capital budgeting
  - Long-term debt + Shareholders' equity => how should the firm raise funds for the selected investments? => capital structure
    - Depends on the industry, age of the company, risk aversion level, etc.
    - What portion of the company is funded by debt/what portion is funded by equity?
  - Current liabilities + Current assets => how should short-term assets be managed and financed => net working capital
    - **Current assets** - anything that can be and is intended to be liquidated in 1 year without major loss in value
    - Companies should operate with positive NWC => difference between current assets and current liabilities
      - May be negative for a period of time after situations involving massive cash outflow
        - If for an extended period of time, worrisome, cannot pay back debt
        - Should not occur if company operates at a loss as a whole

- The Balance Sheet

  - An accountant's snapshot of the firm's accounting value at a specific point in time
  - The balance sheet's identity is Assets == Liabilities + Stockholder's Equity
  - Usually compiled at the end of a quarter
    - 10Q - quarterly, 10K - annually
  - Current assets:
    - Cash and equivalents
    - Accounts receivable => companies make money off of credit, money not obtained yet
    - Inventories => relevant for some industries, not for others
      - World moving towards intangible production (72% in the US)
      - Looking to sell within a year => inventory management is very important
    - Other => shouldn't be too large to avoid SEC investigation
    - Compare splits of LHS to the industry standard
      - More in current assets => current assets don't make money, sub-optimal distribution
        - Short-term - no trouble paying short-term debts
  - Fixed assets:
    - Record everything at cost
    - Use straight-line depreciation to model depreciation of fixed assets
      - Linear depreciation recorded in less accumulated depreciation
    - Intangible assets - IPs, service sector, etc.
      - **Amortization** - depreciation of intangible assets
  - Liabilities
    - Current Liabilities
      - Accounts payable
        - Amount of supply you haven't paid for yet
      - Notes payable == short-term debt
        - Borrowed money
      - Accrued expenses
        - Utilities
    - Long-term liabilities
      - Deferred taxes - pre-arranged delay of tax-paying
      - Long-term debt - bonds
        - Bond market is huge, traded by big institutions
  - Stockholder's equity
    - Preferred stock
    - Common stock
      - Stocks that owners sell, no promise of future payment
    - Capital surplus
      - Stocks + this is the total you get by selling shares
    - Accumulated retained earnings
      - Profit from operation



## Lecture 3: Corporations

- The Corporate Firm

  - The corporate form of business is the standard method f-or solving the problems encounters in raising large amounts of cash

  - However, businesses can take other forms

  - A Comparison:

    - |                                      | Corporation                      | Partnership                                                  |
      | :----------------------------------: | :------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
      |            **Liquidity**             | Shares can be easily exchanged   | Subject to substantial restrictions                          |
      |          **Voting Rights**           | Usually each share gets one vote | General Partner is in charge; limited partners may have some voting rights |
      |             **Taxation**             | Double                           | Partners pay taxes on distributions                          |
      | **Reinvestment and dividend payout** | Broad latitude                   | All net cash flow is distributed to partners                 |
      |            **Liability**             | Limited liability                | General partners may have unlimited liability; limited partners enjoy limited liability |
      |            **Continuity**            | Perpetual life                   | Limited life                                                 |

  - Enables risk taking by separating the business from the person

  - Pros and Cons of Going Public

    - Pros:
      - Obtain money that does not have to be repaid
      - Increased visibility when the company IPOs
      - Market valuation => how much the company is valued at
        - Pricing very delicate, your company is unique, so how do you determine the price at IPO?
        - Don't want stock too high => instant drops are bad for optics
        - Don't want stock too low => missing potential revenue
    - Cons:
      - Going public is costly
        - Hiring intermediary financial advisors to determine stock pricing, insurance, etc.
        - Selling stock happens very rarely after IPO
          - Costly
          - Selling new stock means selling new percentage (your share) or diluting the existing stock (bad for investors)
          - Companies simply go into debt
      - Management loses some of its freedom to act without board approval
      - Open to scrutiny
      - Public reporting
      - Company maybe taken over
        - Stocks being sold and traded => allows one big company to buy up and takeover

- The Importance of Cash Flow

  - Ultimately, the firm must be a cash generating activity
  - The cash flows from the firm must exceed the cash flows from the financial markets
  - Flow diagram:
    - Financial markets => Firm issues securities => Firm
      - Financial instruments that you sell to the public in an effort to collect money
        - Loans/bonds (long-term debt) or stocks (equity)
    - Firm => Cash flow from firm => dividends and debt payments => financial markets
    - Firm => Cash flow from firm => taxes => government
    - Firm => Cash flow from firm => retained cash flows => firm

- The Goal of Financial Management

  - What is the correct goal?
    - Maximize profit?
    - Minimize costs?
    - Maximize market share?
    - Maximize shareholder wealth?
      - The one aspect that provides a summary for the rest

- The Agency Problem

  - Agency relationship
    - Principal hires an agent to represent his/her interest
    - Stockholders (principals) hire managers (agents) to run the company
  - Agency problem
    - Conflict of interest between principal and agent

- Balance Sheet

  - Preferred stock: reserved for initial investors
    - May offer a certain payment regularly
  - Par value: initial stock price at IPO
  - Capital surplus: difference between the amount of money collected from the market and the par value
  - Accumulated retained earnings: the amount of money kept in the company from your profit
    - If growing, retained earnings will grow
    - If you make a loss, retained earnings will decrease
    - Less treasury stock: the company buying back its own shares (negative value)



## Reading 1: Introduction to Corporate Finance

- What is Corporate Finance?
  - In starting a firm, you make in investment in assets like inventory, machinery, land, and labor while matching that investment with cash raised through financing => basis of value creation
  - The Balance Sheet Model of the Firm
    - Financial snapshot of the firm and its activities at a single point in time
    - Assets of the firm located on the LHS of the balance sheet
      - Separated into current and fixed
        - Fixed assets are those that last a long time
          - Some fixed assets are tangible, like machinery and equipment
          - Some fixed assets are intangible, like patents and trademarks
        - Current assets have short lives, like inventory
    - Forms of financing are located on the RHS of the balance sheet
      - Firms issue debt (loan agreements) or equity shares (stock certificates)
      - Liabilities also classified as long or short-lived
        - Short-term debts are current liabilities, loans and other obligations that must be repaid in 1 year
        - Long-term debts are debts that do not have to be repaid in 1 year
      - Shareholders' equity represents the difference between the value of the assets and the debt of the firm
        - It is a residual claim of the firm's assets
    - Finance is a study of the following 3 questions:
      - What long-lived assets should the firm invest? (LHS)
        - Capital budgeting => the process of making and managing expenditures on long-lived assets
      - How can the firm raise cash for required capital expenditures? (RHS)
        - Capital structure => represents the proportions of the firm's financing from current and long-term debt and equity
      - How should short-term operating cash flows be managed? (Upper)
        - Uncertainty/mismatch of cash inflows and outflows
          - Source of cash-flow problems
        - Net working capital => current assets minus current liabilities
  - The Financial Manager
    - Finance activity usually associated with a top officer (VP/CFO)
    - Treasurer and controller report to the CFO
      - Treasurer responsible for handling cash flows, managing capital expenditure decisions, and making financial plans
      - Controller handles the accounting function (taxes, cost, and financial accounting) and information systems
- The Corporate Firm
  - Firm is a way of organizing the economic activity of many individuals
  - Basic problem of the firm is how to raise cash
    - Standard method is the corporate form of business - organizing the firm as a corporation
  - The Sole Proprietorship
    - **Sole proprietorship** - business owned by 1 person
      - The sole proprietorship is the cheapest business to form
        - No formal chapter required
        - Few government regulations must be satisfied
      - Sole proprietorship pays no corporate income taxes
        - All profits taxed as individual income
      - The sole proprietorship has unlimited liability for business debts and obligations
        - No distinction is made between personal and business assets
      - The life of the sole proprietorship is limited by the life of the sole proprietor
      - Equity money that can be raised by the sole proprietor is limited to the proprietor's personal wealth
  - The Partnership
    - **Partnership** - 2+ people get together
    - 2 types of partnerships: general and limited
      - **General partnership** - all partners agree to provide some fraction of the work and cash and to share the profits and losses
        - Each partner is liable for all of the debts of the partnership
        - Agreement may be formal or oral
      - **Limited partnership** - permits liability of some of the partners to be limited to the amount of cash each contributed to the partnership
        - At least 1 partner is a general partner
        - The limited partners do no participate in managing the business
    - Partnerships are usually inexpensive/easy to form
      - Written documents required for complicated agreements
      - Business licenses and filing fees may be necessary
    - General partners have unlimited liability for all debts
      - If 1 general partner is unable to meet his/her commitment, the shortfall must be made up for by the other partners
    - The general partnership is terminated when a general partner dies or withdraws
      - Difficult for a partnership to transfer ownership without dissolving
      - Limited partners may sell their interest in a business
    - Difficult for a partnership to raise large amounts of cash
      - Equity contributions are usually limited to a partner’s ability and desire to contribute to the partnership
    - Income from a partnership is taxed as personal income to the partners
    - Management control resides with the general partners
      - Usually a majority vote is required on important matters, such as the amount of profit to be retained in the business
  - The Corporation
    - **Corporation** - distinct legal entity
      - Can have a name and enjoy legal powers of natural persons
      - More complicated to start than proprietorships or partnerships
        - Incorporators must prepare articles of incorporation and a set of bylaws
          - Name of the corporation
          - Intended life of the corporation
          - Business purpose
          - Number of shares of stock that the corporation is authorized to issue, with a statement of limitations and rights of different classes of shares
          - Nature of the rights granted to shareholders
          - Number of members of the initial board of directors
          - Bylaws are rules to be used by the corporation to regulate its own existence
      - Comprises 3 sets of distinct interests: shareholders, directors, and corporation officers
        - Shareholders control corporation's direction, policies, and activities
          - They elect a board of directors who appoint top management
        - Top management manage the operations of the corporation in the best interest of the shareholders
        - May be large overlap in smaller corporations
      - Ownership can be readily transferred to new owners
        - No limit to the transferability of shares
      - Corporation has unlimited life
        - Separate from owners, death/withdrawal doesn't affect the legal existence of the corporation
      - Shareholders' liability limited to the amount invested in the ownership shares
      - Major advantages: limited liability, ease of ownership transfer, and perpetual succession
      - Major disadvantage: federal government taxes corporate income
        - In addition to other taxes that shareholders pay
    - Creation of new business organization: LLC (limited liability company)
      - Goal is to operate/be taxed like a partnership by retain limited liability for owners
      - IRS can treat LLCs as corporations unless they meet given criteria
      - Popular amongst large accounting firms and law firms
  - A Corporation by Another Name...
    - Variations of the corporate form of organization include joint stock companies, public limited companies, or limited liability companies
- The Importance of Cash Flows
  - Most important job of a financial manager is to create value from the firm’s capital budgeting, financing, and net working capital activities
    - Try to buy assets that generate more cash than they cost
    - Sell bonds and stocks and other financial instruments that raise more cash than they cost
    - In essence, the firm must create more cash flow than it uses
      - Cash flows paid to bondholders and stockholders of the firm should be greater than the cash flows they put into the firm
  - Identification of Cash Flows
    - Sometimes not easy to identify cash flows
    - Much of the information we obtain is within accounting statements
      - Extraction of cash flow information from these statements is the work of financial analysis
  - Timing of Cash Flows
    - The value of an investment made by a firm depends on the timing of cash flows
    - Individuals prefer to receive cash flows earlier rather than later
  - Risk of Cash Flows
    - The amount and timing of cash flows are not usually known with certainty
    - Most investors have an aversion to risk
- The Goal of Financial Management
  - The goal of financial management is to make money or add value for the owners
  - Possible Goals
    - Survive
    - Avoid financial distress and bankruptcy
    - Beat the competition
    - Maximize sales or market share
    - Minimize costs
    - Maximize profits
    - Maintain steady earnings growth
    - These are not precise, presents problems as a goal for the financial manager
    - Goals tend to fall into 2 classes
      - Profitability - earning or increasing profits
        - Sales, market share, cost control
      - Controlling risk 
        - Bankruptcy avoidance, stability, and safety
      - Tend to be contradictory, need a goal that encompasses both factors
  - The Goal of Financial Management
    - What is a good financial management decision?
      - Good decisions increase the value of the stock, and poor decisions decrease the value of the stock
    - Goal: maximize the current value per share of the existing stock
      - No ambiguity, no short-run vs. long-run debate
      - Since stockholders are paid after everyone else, if they're winning, so is everyone else
  - A More General Goal
    - What is the appropriate goal when the firm has no traded stock
    - More general goal: maximize the value of the existing owners' equity
      - Doesn't include illegal/unethical action
      - Financial manager best serves the owners of the business by identifying goods and services that add value to the firm because they are desired and valued in the free marketplace
- The Agency Problem and Control of the Corporation
  - In large corporations, ownership can be spread over a huge number of stockholders
    - Management effectively controls the firm
    - Will management pursue its own goals at the stockholders' expense?
  - Agency Relationships
    - **Agency relationship** - the relationship between stockholders and management
      - Possibility for a conflict of interest between the principal (hirer) and the agent (hired) - **agency problem**
        - May be affected by method of compensation
  - Management Goals
    - **Agency cost** - the costs of the conflict of intereset between stockholders and management
      - Can be indirect or direct
        - Indirect costs include lost opportunities
        - Direct costs come in 2 forms
          - Corporate expenditure that benefits management but costs the stockholders
          - Expense that arises from the need to monitor management actions
    - Left to themselves, managers would tend to maximize the amount of resources over which have control (corporate power/wealth)
      - Could lead to overemphasis on corporate size or growth
  - Do Managers Act in the Stockholders' Interests?
    - Depends on 2 factors:
      - How closely are management goals aligned with stockholder goals?
        - Partially dependent on manner of compensation
      - Can managers be replaced if they do not pusue stockholder goals?
    - Managerial Compensation
      - Management will frequently have a significant economic incentive to increase share value for two reasons:
        - Managerial compensation is usually tied to financial performance in general and share value in particular
          - Able to buy stock at a bargain price => leads to dependence on increasing stockholders' value
        - Job prospects
          - Better performers in the firm will get promoted
          - Managers who are more successful in pursuing stockholder goals will be in greater demand in the labor market => they command larger salaries
    - Control of the Firm
      - Ultimately rests with stockholders => they elect directors who hire and fire management
      - **Proxy fight** - valuable mechanism by which a group solicits proxies to replace the existing board and thereby replace existing management
        - **Proxy** - the authority to vote someone else's stock
      - Firms that are poorly managed are more vulnerable to takeover
        - Greater profit potential exists
    - Stockholders control the firm and stockholder wealth maximization is the relevant goal of the corporation
      - Management goals may still be pursued at the expense of the stockholders

## Reading 2: Financial Statements and Cash Flow

- The Balance Sheet
  - **Balance sheet** - an accountant's snapshot of a firm's accounting value on a particular date
    - 2 sides: assets on the LHS and liabilities/stockholder's equity on the RHS
    - `Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' equity`
      - Must always hold, by definition
      - Stockholders' equity is defined to be the difference between assets and the liabilities of the firm
        - Equity is what the stockholders are left with after the firm has satisfied its obligations
    - 3 concerns: liquidity, debt vs. equity, and value vs. cost
  - Liquidity
    - **Liquidity** - the ease and quickness with which assets can be converted to cash (without significant loss in value)
      - **Current assets** - cash and assets that can be turned into cash within a year
        - Most liquid
      - **Accounts receivable** - amounts not yet collected from customers for goods or services sold to them
      - **Inventory** - composed of raw materials to be used in production, work in process, and finished goods
      - **Fixed assets**
        - Least liquid kind of assets
        - Tangible fixed assets include property, plant, and equipment
        - Intangible fixed assets include trademarks and patents
        - Do not convert to cash from normal business activity, not usually used to pay expenses such as payroll
      - More liquid assets translate to easier time meeting short-term obligations
        - Probability that a firm will avoid financial distress can be linked to its liquidity
        - Liquid assets have lower rates of return than fixed assets
        - Sacrifice liquidity for profit
  - Debt vs. Equity
    - **Liabilities** - obligations of the firm that require a payout within a stipulated period
      - Many involve contractual obligations to repay a stated amount and interest over a period
      - Frequently associated with nominally fixed cash burdens  (**debt service**) that put the firm in default of a contract if not paid
    - **Stockholders' equity** - claim against the firm's assets that is residual and not fixed
      - Accounting value increases when retained earnings are added
  - Value vs. Cost
    - **Carrying value**/**book value** - the accounting value of a firm's assets
    - Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), audited financial statements of firms in the US carry assets at cost
    - **Market value** - price at which buyers and sellers would trade the assets
      - Coincidence if accounting value and market value were the same
      - Management's job is to create value for the firm that exceeds its cost
- The Income Statement
  - **Income Statement** - measures performance over a specific period
  - `Revenue - Expenses = Income`
  - Balance sheet is a snapshot, the income statement is a video recording of what happened between 2 snapshots
  - Several sections:
    - Operations section reports the firm's revenues and expenses from principal operations
      - EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes)
    - Non-operating section includes all financing costs, such as interest expense
      - Second section reports as a separate item the amount of taxes levied on income
    - Last item is the bottom line - net income
      - Expressed per share of common stock (earnings per share)
  - Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
    - Revenue is recognized on an income statement when the earnings process is virtually completed and an exchange of goods or services has occurred
      - Unrealized appreciation from owning property will not be recognized as income
        - Allows for a device to smooth income
    - Matching principle of GAAP dictates that revenues be matched with expenses
      - Income is reported when it is earned, regardless of if cash flow occurred
  - Noncash Items
    - **Noncash items** - expenses against revenues that do not affect cash flow
    - **Depreciation** - reflection of the accountant's estimate of the cost of equipment used up in the production process
      - Cost must be used up over the useful life of the asset
    - **Deferred taxes** - result from difference between accounting income and true taxable income
      - Not a cash outflow, but shows up on the balance sheet as deferred tax liability
      - Theory is that if taxable income is less than accounting income in the current year, it will be more than accounting income later on
    - Difference between cash flows and accounting income can be quite dramatic
  - Time and Costs
    - Visualize future time as having the short-run and the long-run
      - **Short-run** - period in which certain equipment, resources, and commitments of the firm are fixed
        - Long enough time to vary outputs
        - Decisions in the short-run have fixed costs (costs that don't change due to fixed commitments)
          - Bond interest, overhead, property taxes, etc.
        - Costs that aren't fixed are variable => change as the output of the firm changes
          - Raw materials, wages, etc.
      - **Long-run** - all costs are variable
        - Distinguishes product costs from period costs
          - **Product cost** - total production costs incurred during a period and are reported on the income statement as cost of goods sold
          - **Period cost** - costs that are allocated to a time period
            - Selling, general, and administrative expenses
- Taxes
  - Can be one of the largest cash outflows a firm experiences
  - Size of a firm's tax bill is determined by the tax code
    - Result of political, not economic forces
  - Corporate Tax Rates
    - Corporate tax rates are not strictly increasing
      - Instituted by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
    - Only 4 corporate rates according to the originators of the current tax rules
      - 15%, 25%, 34%, and 35%
      - 38% and 39% brackets arise due to surcharges applied to the 34% and 35% rates => really 6 corporate tax brackets
  - Average vs. Marginal Tax Rates
    - **Average tax rate** - tax bill divided by your taxable income
      - The percentage of your income that goes to pay taxes
    - **Marginal tax rate** - the tax you would pay if you earned 1 more dollar
      - Tells us the marginal effect of a decision on our tax bill
    - **Flat-rate tax** - there is only 1 tax rate, so the rate is the same for all income levels
      - Marginal tax == average tax rate
      - US uses a modified flat-rate tax that becomes a true flat-rate tax at high incomes
    - Under current tax law, average tax rates never go down despite marginal tax rates decreasing
    - Average/marginal tax rates are 35% => federal
- Net Working Capital
  - `NWC = Current Assets - Current Liabilities`
  - **Change in net working capital** - a firm can invest in NWC
    - Usually positive in a growing firm
