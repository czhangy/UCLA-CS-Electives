# Rising Inflation

This week, we've continued to explore the unprecedented effects that COVID has had on our economy. In an article describing the aftermath of COVID-related spikes in consumer spending, commodity prices, etc., it's noted that many of these factors may end up coalescing into uncontrollable levels of inflation. While the article did focus on the UK, it ends with projections that the US may fall victim to the same effects. These projections are contrary to the actions of the national banks and Treasury, however, they must still be taken into consideration as we move forward with global recovery from the pandemic.
