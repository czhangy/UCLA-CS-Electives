# US Used Car Market is Driving Inflation

In this article, the economic uncertainties of the pandemic are once again touched on. A combination of the savings and government stimuli brought about in the pandemic has led to an extraordinarily high demand for used cars, far outweighing their available supply. This has led to a massive uptick in their sales prices, which economists believe can be used as a proxy for future inflation concerns. While this trend is expected to dissipate in the near future, economists are still concerned due to the novel nature of the trend. They still believe there's a relatively high chance this trend may stick around and spread into other markets, resulting in a major struggle for the economy down the road. As a result, it wouldn't be surprising to see policymakers in Washington attempt to stunt the growth of this trend before it reaches a boiling point.
