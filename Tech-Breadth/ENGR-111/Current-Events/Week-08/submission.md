# Europe's Record-High Carbon Price

This article focuses on the Europe's ETS cap-and-trade system, which has recently reached a record-high per-ton price for carbon emissions. It notes that the recent changes are likely due to the relatively cold start to the year, the new willingness to push against climate change, and recent policy shifts to limit an oversupply of credits that weakened the system before. The article also notes that the US has decided to move away from this sort of approach due to it appearing somewhat ineffective in the past. However, Europe's recent success with the method has shown that it can be functional and force emissions to decline. It's worth noting that there are still issues on the horizon, and how well this system can deal with them is left to be seen.
