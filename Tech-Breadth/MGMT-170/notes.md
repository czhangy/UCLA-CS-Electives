## Lecture 1: Basic Legal Concepts

- What is Real Estate?
  - Real estate is land and all things that are "permanently" attached to the land
  - "Permanent" => in reality, anything can be torn down
- Real vs. Personal Property
  - Real property consists of ownership rights associated with real estate
  - Personal property consists of movable things and intangibles
    - Fixtures are personal property until they are attached to a building, then they become a part of the real property
- Statute of Frauds
  - Requires that almost every agreement relating to real property be in writing in order to be enforceable in a court of law (from England 1677)
- Property Rights and Estates in Real Estate
  - Ownership, possessory, and use rights
  - The most complete form of ownership is a fee simple absolute (or "fee simple" or "fee")
    - Subsurface + air rights
  - A life estate lasts only for the life of the named person
    - Afterwards, the estate is either transferred to a third party or returned to the original owner
  - A future estate can be a remainder interest or a reversion interest
  - Easement
    - A non-ownership, non-possessory right to use or access land own or leased by someone else
      - They are very limited in nature
    - i.e., utilities
  - Leasehold Estate/Lease
    - Real property can be leased by the landlord/lessor to the tenant/lessee for a particular purpose for a particular period of time
    - Leases over one year must be in writing to be enforceable under the statute of frauds
- Ownership
  - A title determines ownership of the real property and is evidence by a deed
  - A deed is a document that grants or transfers title to real property from a grantor to a grantee
    - The strongest is a general warranty deed, while the weakest is a quitclaim deed
    - Certain deed restrictions are not enforceable under non-discrimination laws
  - Title insurance is a method of assuring title to real property used in California and all other states
    - Two kinds: owner's policy and lender's policy
- Security Interests
  - A borrower signs a mortgage (or deed of trust) as the mortgagor (or trustor) in favor of a lender who is the mortgagee (or beneficiary) pledging real estate owned by the borrower to secure the repayment of a loan
  - In essence, helps the lender get repaid
- Recording Act
  - All states have statutory rules to resolve the priority of claims relating to real property and to give the public constructive notice of recorded items
  - Abstract of Title
    - Historical summary of the publicly recorded documents that affect title to real property
  - Mechanic's Lien
    - May be recorded by unpaid contractors, workers, and materials providers to secure payment for their work on real estate and, in California, may be recorded up to 90 days after the work is completed or the materials are supplied
    - Essentially a placeholder for paying off at a later date
    - Must be in relation to real property



## Lecture 2: Notes and Mortgages

- Promissory Note: documents a loan between a borrower and a lender
  - Must include the parties, loan amount, interest rate, and maturity date
  - Usually includes clauses relating to amortization, assumability or "due on sale", recourse or non-recourse, prepayment or lockout, assignment, default and acceleration
    - Assumability vs. "Due on Sale": who continues to pay off the loan when the property is eventually sold
    - Recourse vs. Non-recourse: if the lender can sue for any deficit in the event of a foreclosure
    - Prepayment vs. Lockout: whether or not there are restrictions on the borrower's repayment of the loan
    - Acceleration: moving in of the maturity date
- Default: the failure to perform any of the terms or conditions of the loan or mortgage
  - The most common mortgage default is the failure to pay interest and principal when due
  - Default can lead to acceleration of the load and foreclosure of the property
- Foreclosure: with a deed of trust, can be judicial (in court) or non-judicial (out of court) and involves a lends ultimately taking title to real property or forcing a sale of the property to satisfy the unpaid mortgage balance
  - All junior mortgages are extinguished when a senior mortgage lender forecloses on a property, but the debt secured by those junior mortgages is generally unaffected by the foreclosure
- Bankruptcy: liquidation and reorganization of a business
- Mortgage: a two-part security interest in real property to secure the repayment of a real estate loan that is given by a borrower/mortgagor to a lender/mortgagee
- Deed of Trust: a three-party security interest in real property that is given by a borrower/trustor to an independent trustee to secure the repayment of a real estate loan for the benefit of a lender/beneficiary
  - Used in California and most other states where it's available, because it is preferred over a two-party mortgage
- Senior vs. Junior Mortgage: determined by state statutes that determine the priority of recording, unless the prior recorded mortgage contains a subordination clause
- Construction Loan: a loan for the construction of a building or improvements
  - Loan draws are made against a maximum loan amount, are secured by a mortgage or deed of trust against the real property, usually with recourse to the developer
- Purchase Money Loan: a loan made for a borrower to purchase real estate
- Short Sale: when a lender allows the sale of a property for less than the outstanding loan balance
