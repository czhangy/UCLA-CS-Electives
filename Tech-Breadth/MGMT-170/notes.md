## Lecture 1: Basic Legal Concepts

- What is Real Estate?
  - Real estate is land and all things that are "permanently" attached to the land
  - "Permanent" => in reality, anything can be torn down
- Real vs. Personal Property
  - Real property consists of ownership rights associated with real estate
  - Personal property consists of movable things and intangibles
    - Fixtures are personal property until they are attached to a building, then they become a part of the real property
- Statute of Frauds
  - Requires that almost every agreement relating to real property be in writing in order to be enforceable in a court of law (from England 1677)
- Property Rights and Estates in Real Estate
  - Ownership, possessory, and use rights
  - The most complete form of ownership is a fee simple absolute (or "fee simple" or "fee")
    - Subsurface + air rights
  - A life estate lasts only for the life of the named person
    - Afterwards, the estate is either transferred to a third party or returned to the original owner
  - A future estate can be a remainder interest or a reversion interest
  - Easement
    - A non-ownership, non-possessory right to use or access land own or leased by someone else
      - They are very limited in nature
    - i.e., utilities
  - Leasehold Estate/Lease
    - Real property can be leased by the landlord/lessor to the tenant/lessee for a particular purpose for a particular period of time
    - Leases over one year must be in writing to be enforceable under the statute of frauds
- Ownership
  - A title determines ownership of the real property and is evidence by a deed
  - A deed is a document that grants or transfers title to real property from a grantor to a grantee
    - The strongest is a general warranty deed, while the weakest is a quitclaim deed
    - Certain deed restrictions are not enforceable under non-discrimination laws
  - Title insurance is a method of assuring title to real property used in California and all other states
    - Two kinds: owner's policy and lender's policy
- Security Interests
  - A borrower signs a mortgage (or deed of trust) as the mortgagor (or trustor) in favor of a lender who is the mortgagee (or beneficiary) pledging real estate owned by the borrower to secure the repayment of a loan
  - In essence, helps the lender get repaid
- Recording Act
  - All states have statutory rules to resolve the priority of claims relating to real property and to give the public constructive notice of recorded items
  - Abstract of Title
    - Historical summary of the publicly recorded documents that affect title to real property
  - Mechanic's Lien
    - May be recorded by unpaid contractors, workers, and materials providers to secure payment for their work on real estate and, in California, may be recorded up to 90 days after the work is completed or the materials are supplied
    - Essentially a placeholder for paying off at a later date
    - Must be in relation to real property



## Lecture 2: Notes and Mortgages

- Promissory Note: documents a loan between a borrower and a lender
  - Must include the parties, loan amount, interest rate, and maturity date
  - Usually includes clauses relating to amortization, assumability or "due on sale", recourse or non-recourse, prepayment or lockout, assignment, default and acceleration
    - Assumability vs. "Due on Sale": who continues to pay off the loan when the property is eventually sold
    - Recourse vs. Non-recourse: if the lender can sue for any deficit in the event of a foreclosure
    - Prepayment vs. Lockout: whether or not there are restrictions on the borrower's repayment of the loan
    - Acceleration: moving in of the maturity date
- Default: the failure to perform any of the terms or conditions of the loan or mortgage
  - The most common mortgage default is the failure to pay interest and principal when due
  - Default can lead to acceleration of the load and foreclosure of the property
- Foreclosure: with a deed of trust, can be judicial (in court) or non-judicial (out of court) and involves a lends ultimately taking title to real property or forcing a sale of the property to satisfy the unpaid mortgage balance
  - All junior mortgages are extinguished when a senior mortgage lender forecloses on a property, but the debt secured by those junior mortgages is generally unaffected by the foreclosure
  - The lender is only entitled to take the amount of principal + accrued interest from the sale
- Bankruptcy: liquidation and reorganization of a business
- Mortgage: a two-part security interest in real property to secure the repayment of a real estate loan that is given by a borrower/mortgagor to a lender/mortgagee
- Deed of Trust: a three-party security interest in real property that is given by a borrower/trustor to an independent trustee to secure the repayment of a real estate loan for the benefit of a lender/beneficiary
  - Used in California and most other states where it's available, because it is preferred over a two-party mortgage
- Senior vs. Junior Mortgage: determined by state statutes that determine the priority of recording, unless the prior recorded mortgage contains a subordination clause
- Construction Loan: a loan for the construction of a building or improvements
  - Loan draws are made against a maximum loan amount, are secured by a mortgage or deed of trust against the real property, usually with recourse to the developer
- Purchase Money Loan: a loan made for a borrower to purchase real estate
- Short Sale: when a lender allows the sale of a property for less than the outstanding loan balance



## Lecture 3: Time Value of Money and Fixed Rate Mortgages

- Time Value of Money

  - Compound Interest: `(1 + i)^n` where `i` is the periodic interest rate and `n` is the number of periods that are compounded

  - Compounding: approach to taking a present value to a future value

    - $$
      FV=PV\times(1+i)^n
      $$

  - Discounting: approach to taking a future value back to present value

    - $$
      PV=\frac{FV}{(1+i)^n}
      $$

  - Annuities (PMT): investments with constant future periodic payments

  - Interest Rate (`i`), Effective Yield, Internal Rate of Return (IRR): various measures of the return on capital or the cost of capital

  - Net Present Value (NPV): the present value of all projected future cash flows discounted at a specified discount rate, less the cost of the investment

  - Internal Rate of Return (IRR): the calculated discount rate at which the present value of all projected future cash flows is equal to the cost of the investment

  - Risk: is essential to evaluate in order to determine whether the expected investment return is sufficient in light of the perceived risk

    - Measured relative to the return of the investment

- Fixed Rate Mortgages

  - Capital Markets: financial and security markets, including the mortgage market
  - Loan Availability: economic growth prospects (global, national, and local), expected inflation, and other risks all affect the supply and cost of mortgage funds
  - Lenders as Intermediaries: most real estate lenders sell the loans they originate into the secondary mortgage market rather than holding the loads to maturity
  - Loan Pricing: the interest rate, any fees, points, and costs charged by the lender, and the loan terms (including any prepayment penalties)
  - Real Interest Rate: the nominal or contract interest rate minus expected inflation
  - Risk Adjusted Return: expected investment return relative to the perceived risk
  - Amortization: the process of repaying the principal balance of a loan over time
    - An interest-only loan has a constant principal balance
    - An amortized loan tacks extra for the repayment of the principal balance over time
  - Balloon Payment: the principal balance of the loan due on the maturity date
    - Fully-amortized loans will have a balloon payment of 0
  - Pay Rate vs. Accrual Rate: is the actual monthly mortgage payment that is made by a borrower at least equal to the accrued interest amount than due on the loan?
    - Pay rate < accrual rate: negative amortization
  - Constant Payment Mortgage: when each monthly payment is the same, the loan will be fully amortizing, partially amortizing, interest only, or negative amortizing
    - Designed for the total payment (interest + principal) to be constant
      - Results in the payment consisting of mostly interest at the beginning and mostly principal towards the end
      - Quadratic in balances
    - Fully amortizing, constant payment mortgage is designed for a FV of 0
    - Partially amortizing loans amortize down to a given payment at the loan's maturity date
    - Interest only, constant payment mortgage would be designed for a FV of the negative of the initial principal amount
      - Allows for the affording of a bigger loan
    - Negative amortizing: principal balance grows
  - Constant Amortization Mortgage: when each payment includes a fixed amount of principal repayment, with the monthly payment and interest amounts declining
    - Designed for the principal payment to be constant
      - Total payment varies as interest declines over time
      - Linear in balances
    - Very rare because of the high payments early in the loan
    - Less total interest payment over the lifespan of the loan
  - Effective Annual Interest Rate: calculation that considers all loan fees, points, and costs and any prepayment penalties actually paid, and is therefore affected by the amount of time the loan is held until repayment



## Lecture 4: Fixed and Adjustable Rate Mortgages

- Fixed Rate Mortgages
  - Reverse Annuity Mortgage: the lender sends fixed monthly checks to the borrower who must pay the accumulated principal and accrued interest on the maturity date
  - Loan Fees and Costs: origination fees (for loan underwriting and processing), appraisal and credit report
    - Loan fees and points increase the lender's yield
  - Annual Percentage Rate (APR): provides disclosure regarding the effects of loan fees, points, and costs on residential loans (assumes the loan is held to maturity)
  - Truth-in-Lending Act: Federal Reserve Regulation Z requires lenders to include in APR calculations all loan fees, points, and costs, but not any prepayment penalties
  - Prepayment Penalties: increase the effective yield to the lender, are subject to negotiation and are not reflected in the APR of a loan
    - If a prepayment penalty is paid, the effective yield to the lender will be higher if the loan is repaid earlier
- Adjustable/Floating/Variable Rate Mortgages
  - Interest Rate Changes: indexed to other market interest rates (plus a margin)
  - Index: LIBOR (London Inter Bank Offered Rate), US Treasuries, COFI (11th district Cost of Funds Index), Prime
    - The index can be 6 months, 1 year, or another rate series
    - LIBOR being phased out
  - Margin: lender's profit margin or spread (fixed for the loan term) over the index
  - Composite Rate: the index + margin is the composite interest rate on the loan
  - Reset Dates: when the interest rate changes (usually every 6 months or 1 year)
    - Dependent on the loan agreement
  - Caps and Floors: caps are the maximum and floors are the minimum allowed periodic and/or lifetime adjustments of the interest rate or loan payment amount
    - Floors are ineffective if borrowers can refinance with no prepayment penalty => the lender can be replaced when interest rates fall
  - Payment Shock: when the interest rate fully adjusts to the current composite rate, the new loan payment amount is often substantially higher than the teaser rate
  - Teaser Rate: initial interest rate on the loan, often far below the composite rate
  - Interest Only or Amortizing: as with fixed rate loans, ARMs are usually fully amortizing, but can also be written as interest only or partially amortizing
  - Loan Fees and Costs: as with fixed rate loans, origination fees, points, and costs may be charged to the borrower to increase the effective yield to the lender
  - Loan Terms: are generally the same terms with fixed rate loans, other than the interest rate changes, and include assumable or "due on sale", recourse or non-recourse, prepayment or lockout, assignment, default, and acceleration
  - Negative Amortization: if the loan payment required is less than the amount of accrued interest then due on the loan because of a payment cap, there will be negative amortization
    - Interest rate caps do not cause negative amortization
  - Interest Rate Risk: because ARM interest rates adjust periodically, interest rate risk is higher for the norrower and lower for the lender
    - The shorter the time interval between reset dates, the higher the risk for the borrower and lower for the lender
    - Lender's much happier with adjustable rate loans
  - Default Risk: because the interest rate adjusts periodically, the potential for future rate increases elevates the risk of a default by the borrower leading to foreclosure
    - Higher for adjustable rate loans for both the borrower and the lender's perspective
  - Hybrid ARMs: 3/1, 5/1, 7/1, or 10/1 are fixed rate loans for the first 3, 5, 7, or 10 years, then become adjustable rate loans with annual interest rate reset dates
    - The "1" refers to an adjustment of the adjustment period of 1 year
      - Shortening to 6 months
  - Conversion Option: the right of the borrower to convert the loan from an ARM to a fixed rate loan at a specified future date, usually with a fee paid to the lender
    - Acts at the current interest rate
