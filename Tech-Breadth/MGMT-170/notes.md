## Lecture 1: Basic Legal Concepts

- What is Real Estate?
  - Real estate is land and all things that are "permanently" attached to the land
  - "Permanent" => in reality, anything can be torn down
- Real vs. Personal Property
  - Real property consists of ownership rights associated with real estate
  - Personal property consists of movable things and intangibles
    - Fixtures are personal property until they are attached to a building, then they become a part of the real property
- Statute of Frauds
  - Requires that almost every agreement relating to real property be in writing in order to be enforceable in a court of law (from England 1677)
- Property Rights and Estates in Real Estate
  - Ownership, possessory, and use rights
  - The most complete form of ownership is a fee simple absolute (or "fee simple" or "fee")
    - Subsurface + air rights
  - A life estate lasts only for the life of the named person
    - Afterwards, the estate is either transferred to a third party or returned to the original owner
  - A future estate can be a remainder interest or a reversion interest
  - Easement
    - A non-ownership, non-possessory right to use or access land own or leased by someone else
      - They are very limited in nature
    - i.e., utilities
  - Leasehold Estate/Lease
    - Real property can be leased by the landlord/lessor to the tenant/lessee for a particular purpose for a particular period of time
    - Leases over one year must be in writing to be enforceable under the statute of frauds
- Ownership
  - A title determines ownership of the real property and is evidence by a deed
  - A deed is a document that grants or transfers title to real property from a grantor to a grantee
    - The strongest is a general warranty deed, while the weakest is a quitclaim deed
    - Certain deed restrictions are not enforceable under non-discrimination laws
  - Title insurance is a method of assuring title to real property used in California and all other states
    - Two kinds: owner's policy and lender's policy
- Security Interests
  - A borrower signs a mortgage (or deed of trust) as the mortgagor (or trustor) in favor of a lender who is the mortgagee (or beneficiary) pledging real estate owned by the borrower to secure the repayment of a loan
  - In essence, helps the lender get repaid
- Recording Act
  - All states have statutory rules to resolve the priority of claims relating to real property and to give the public constructive notice of recorded items
  - Abstract of Title
    - Historical summary of the publicly recorded documents that affect title to real property
  - Mechanic's Lien
    - May be recorded by unpaid contractors, workers, and materials providers to secure payment for their work on real estate and, in California, may be recorded up to 90 days after the work is completed or the materials are supplied
    - Essentially a placeholder for paying off at a later date
    - Must be in relation to real property
