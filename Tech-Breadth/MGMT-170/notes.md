## Lecture 1: Basic Legal Concepts

- **Real Estate**: land and all things that are "permanently" attached to the land
  - "Permanent" => in reality, anything can be torn down

- **Real Property**: ownership rights associated with real estate

  - Land and all things permanently attached to it

- **Personal Property**: movable things and intangibles

  - Fixtures are personal property until they are attached to a building, then they become a part of the real property

- **Statute of Frauds**: requires that almost every agreement relating to real property be in writing in order to be enforceable in a court of law (from England 1677)

- **Property Rights and Estates in Real Estate**: ownership, possessory, and use rights

  - The most complete form of ownership is a fee simple absolute (or "fee simple" or "fee")
    - Subsurface + air rights
  - A life estate lasts only for the life of the named person
    - Afterwards, the estate is either transferred to a third party or returned to the original owner
  - A future estate can be a remainder interest or a reversion interest

- **Easement**: a non-ownership, non-possessory right to use or access land own or leased by someone else

  - Very limited in nature

  - Ex) utilities

- **Leasehold Estate/Lease**: real property can be leased by the landlord/lessor to the tenant/lessee for a particular purpose for a particular period of time

  - Leases over one year must be in writing to be enforceable under the statute of frauds
  - Gives the tenant the right to possess and use

- **Title**: determines ownership of the real property and is evidenced by a deed

- **Deed**: a document that grants or transfers title to real property from a grantor to a grantee

  - The strongest is a general warranty deed, while the weakest is a quitclaim deed
  - Certain deed restrictions are not enforceable under non-discrimination laws

- **Title Insurance**: a method of assuring title to real property used in California and all other states

  - Two kinds: owner's policy and lender's policy
  - Lender's policy: insures that any insured title claim against the property will be covered up to the loan amount

- **Security Interests**: a borrower signs a mortgage (or deed of trust) as the mortgagor (or trustor) in favor of a lender who is the mortgagee (or beneficiary) pledging real estate owned by the borrower to secure the repayment of a loan

  - In essence, helps the lender get repaid

- **Recording Act**: all states have statutory rules to resolve the priority of claims relating to real property and to give the public constructive notice of recorded items

- **Abstract of Title**: historical summary of the publicly recorded documents that affect title to real property

- **Mechanic's Lien**: may be recorded by unpaid contractors, workers, and materials providers to secure payment for their work on real estate and, in California, may be recorded up to 90 days after the work is completed or the materials are supplied

  - Essentially a placeholder for paying off at a later date
  - Must be in relation to real property



## Lecture 2: Notes and Mortgages

- **Promissory Note**: documents a loan between a borrower and a lender
  - Must include the parties, loan amount, interest rate, and maturity date
  - Usually includes clauses relating to amortization, assumability or "due on sale", recourse or non-recourse, prepayment or lockout, assignment, default and acceleration
    - Assumability vs. "Due on Sale": who continues to pay off the loan when the property is eventually sold
    - Recourse vs. Non-recourse: if the lender can sue for any deficit in the event of a foreclosure
    - Prepayment vs. Lockout: whether or not there are restrictions on the borrower's repayment of the loan
    - Acceleration: moving in of the maturity date
- **Default**: the failure to perform any of the terms or conditions of the loan or mortgage
  - The most common mortgage default is the failure to pay interest and principal when due
  - Default can lead to acceleration of the load and foreclosure of the property
- **Foreclosure**: with a deed of trust, can be judicial (in court) or non-judicial (out of court) and involves a lends ultimately taking title to real property or forcing a sale of the property to satisfy the unpaid mortgage balance
  - All junior mortgages are extinguished when a senior mortgage lender forecloses on a property, but the debt secured by those junior mortgages is generally unaffected by the foreclosure
  - The lender is only entitled to take the amount of principal + accrued interest from the sale
- **Bankruptcy**: liquidation and reorganization of a business
- **Mortgage**: a two-part security interest in real property to secure the repayment of a real estate loan that is given by a borrower/mortgagor to a lender/mortgagee
- **Deed of Trust**: a three-party security interest in real property that is given by a borrower/trustor to an independent trustee to secure the repayment of a real estate loan for the benefit of a lender/beneficiary
  - Used in California and most other states where it's available, because it is preferred over a two-party mortgage
- **Senior vs. Junior Mortgage**: determined by state statutes that determine the priority of recording, unless the prior recorded mortgage contains a subordination clause
- **Construction Loan**: a loan for the construction of a building or improvements
  - Loan draws are made against a maximum loan amount, are secured by a mortgage or deed of trust against the real property, usually with recourse to the developer
- **Purchase Money Loan**: a loan made for a borrower to purchase real estate
- **Short Sale**: when a lender allows the sale of a property for less than the outstanding loan balance



## Lecture 3: Time Value of Money and Fixed Rate Mortgages

- Time Value of Money

  - **Compound Interest**: `(1 + i)^n` where `i` is the periodic interest rate and `n` is the number of periods that are compounded

  - **Compounding**: approach to taking a present value to a future value

    - $$
      FV=PV\times(1+i)^n
      $$

  - **Discounting**: approach to taking a future value back to present value

    - $$
      PV=\frac{FV}{(1+i)^n}
      $$

  - **Annuities (PMT)**: investments with constant future periodic payments

  - **Interest Rate (`i`), Effective Yield, Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: various measures of the return on capital or the cost of capital

  - **Net Present Value (NPV)**: the present value of all projected future cash flows discounted at a specified discount rate, less the cost of the investment

  - **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: the calculated discount rate at which the present value of all projected future cash flows is equal to the cost of the investment

  - **Risk**: is essential to evaluate in order to determine whether the expected investment return is sufficient in light of the perceived risk

    - Measured relative to the return of the investment

- Fixed Rate Mortgages

  - **Capital Markets**: financial and security markets, including the mortgage market
  - **Loan Availability**: economic growth prospects (global, national, and local), expected inflation, and other risks all affect the supply and cost of mortgage funds
  - **Lenders as Intermediaries**: most real estate lenders sell the loans they originate into the secondary mortgage market rather than holding the loads to maturity
  - **Loan Pricing**: the interest rate, any fees, points, and costs charged by the lender, and the loan terms (including any prepayment penalties)
  - **Real Interest Rate**: the nominal or contract interest rate minus expected inflation
  - **Risk Adjusted Return**: expected investment return relative to the perceived risk
  - **Amortization**: the process of repaying the principal balance of a loan over time
    - An interest-only loan has a constant principal balance
    - An amortized loan tacks extra for the repayment of the principal balance over time
  - **Balloon Payment**: the principal balance of the loan due on the maturity date
    - Fully-amortized loans will have a balloon payment of 0
  - **Pay Rate vs. Accrual Rate**: is the actual monthly mortgage payment that is made by a borrower at least equal to the accrued interest amount than due on the loan?
    - Pay rate < accrual rate: negative amortization
  - **Constant Payment Mortgage**: when each monthly payment is the same, the loan will be fully amortizing, partially amortizing, interest only, or negative amortizing
    - Designed for the total payment (interest + principal) to be constant
      - Results in the payment consisting of mostly interest at the beginning and mostly principal towards the end
      - Quadratic in balances
    - Fully amortizing, constant payment mortgage is designed for a FV of 0
    - Partially amortizing loans amortize down to a given payment at the loan's maturity date
    - Interest only, constant payment mortgage would be designed for a FV of the negative of the initial principal amount
      - Allows for the affording of a bigger loan
    - Negative amortizing: principal balance grows
  - **Constant Amortization Mortgage**: when each payment includes a fixed amount of principal repayment, with the monthly payment and interest amounts declining
    - Designed for the principal payment to be constant
      - Total payment varies as interest declines over time
      - Linear in balances
    - Very rare because of the high payments early in the loan
    - Less total interest payment over the lifespan of the loan
  - **Effective Annual Interest Rate**: calculation that considers all loan fees, points, and costs and any prepayment penalties actually paid, and is therefore affected by the amount of time the loan is held until repayment



## Lecture 4: Fixed and Adjustable Rate Mortgages

- Fixed Rate Mortgages
  - **Reverse Annuity Mortgage**: the lender sends fixed monthly checks to the borrower who must pay the accumulated principal and accrued interest on the maturity date
  - **Loan Fees and Costs**: origination fees (for loan underwriting and processing), appraisal and credit report
    - Loan fees and points increase the lender's yield
  - **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**: provides disclosure regarding the effects of loan fees, points, and costs on residential loans (assumes the loan is held to maturity)
  - **Truth-in-Lending Act**: Federal Reserve Regulation Z requires lenders to include in APR calculations all loan fees, points, and costs, but not any prepayment penalties
  - **Prepayment Penalties**: increase the effective yield to the lender, are subject to negotiation and are not reflected in the APR of a loan
    - If a prepayment penalty is paid, the effective yield to the lender will be higher if the loan is repaid earlier
- Adjustable/Floating/Variable Rate Mortgages
  - **Interest Rate Changes**: indexed to other market interest rates (plus a margin)
  - **Index**: LIBOR (London Inter Bank Offered Rate), US Treasuries, COFI (11th district Cost of Funds Index), Prime
    - The index can be 6 months, 1 year, or another rate series
    - LIBOR being phased out
  - **Margin**: lender's profit margin or spread (fixed for the loan term) over the index
  - **Composite Rate**: the index + margin is the composite interest rate on the loan
  - **Reset Dates**: when the interest rate changes (usually every 6 months or 1 year)
    - Dependent on the loan agreement
  - **Caps and Floors**: caps are the maximum and floors are the minimum allowed periodic and/or lifetime adjustments of the interest rate or loan payment amount
    - Floors are ineffective if borrowers can refinance with no prepayment penalty => the lender can be replaced when interest rates fall
  - **Payment Shock**: when the interest rate fully adjusts to the current composite rate, the new loan payment amount is often substantially higher than the teaser rate
  - **Teaser Rate**: initial interest rate on the loan, often far below the composite rate
  - **Interest Only or Amortizing**: as with fixed rate loans, ARMs are usually fully amortizing, but can also be written as interest only or partially amortizing
  - **Loan Fees and Costs**: as with fixed rate loans, origination fees, points, and costs may be charged to the borrower to increase the effective yield to the lender
  - **Loan Terms**: are generally the same terms with fixed rate loans, other than the interest rate changes, and include assumable or "due on sale", recourse or non-recourse, prepayment or lockout, assignment, default, and acceleration
  - **Negative Amortization**: if the loan payment required is less than the amount of accrued interest then due on the loan because of a payment cap, there will be negative amortization
    - Interest rate caps do not cause negative amortization
  - **Interest Rate Risk**: because ARM interest rates adjust periodically, interest rate risk is higher for the norrower and lower for the lender
    - The shorter the time interval between reset dates, the higher the risk for the borrower and lower for the lender
    - Lender's much happier with adjustable rate loans
  - **Default Risk**: because the interest rate adjusts periodically, the potential for future rate increases elevates the risk of a default by the borrower leading to foreclosure
    - Higher for adjustable rate loans for both the borrower and the lender's perspective
  - **Hybrid ARMs**: 3/1, 5/1, 7/1, or 10/1 are fixed rate loans for the first 3, 5, 7, or 10 years, then become adjustable rate loans with annual interest rate reset dates
    - The "1" refers to an adjustment of the adjustment period of 1 year
      - Shortening to 6 months
  - **Conversion Option**: the right of the borrower to convert the loan from an ARM to a fixed rate loan at a specified future date, usually with a fee paid to the lender
    - Acts at the current interest rate



## Lecture 5: Adjustable Rate Mortgages

- Longer maturity dates result in increased risk for the lender
- Lol nothing else



## Lecture 6: Additional Mortgage Concepts and Leases

- Mortgages
  - **Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV)**: mortgage debt divided by property value (or price)
  - **Market Value of a Loan**: the present value of all expected future loan payments (i.e., all expected future payments of principal and interest)
  - **Incremental Borrowing Cost**: the marginal cost of the additional amount borrowed, taking into consideration the interest rate and other loan fees, points, and costs
  - **Home Equity Line of Credit**: a home equity line of credit (HELOC) can be secured by a first, second, or more junior mortgage and is typically a revolving line of credit
- Leases
  - **Commercial Properties**: office, retail, apartment, industrial, hotel, mixed-use, etc.
  - **Supply and Demand Analysis**: important for the valuation of properties and the projection of future rent and occupancy levels
    - Global, national, regional, and local factors affect the value of properties and rent levels for commercial space
  - **Location**: the most important factor in real estate because it's location specific
  - **Occupancy/Vacancy**: `occupancy = 100& - vacancy`
    - Driven by many factors, including supply and demand, location, quality (age, design, construction, etc.)
  - **Lease Terms**: the parties (landlord/tenant or lessor/lessee), premises, term, base rent, CPI increases or percentage rent, security deposit and/or guarantors, allowable uses, insurance, repairs and maintenance, damage or destruction, property taxes and other expenses, assignment and subletting, defaults and remedies, subordination, attornment and non-disturbance, signage, right of first refusal or expansion option on adjacent space, notices, governing law
    - Premises define the exact real estate under consideration
    - Start with base rent, landlord wants this to increase over time
    - Security deposits prevent the tenant from abandoning the contract terms
    - Allowable uses define what is allowed on the premises
  - **Rental Income**: flat base rent, step-up rent, CPI or indexed rent with caps or floors, percentage rent with overage rent above a sales amount breakpoint
  - **Concessions**: free rent, reduced rent, tenant improvement allowance (TI)
  - **Property Expenses**: gross leases (tenant pays no expenses), modified gross leases (e.g., electricity), triple net leases (tenant pays all operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and utilities)
  - **Expense Stop**: property expenses per rentable square for up to the expense stop will be paid by the landlord with expenses over that amount paid by the tenant
  - **Rentable vs. Usable Square Feet**: rentable square footage is usable square footage plus the tenant's pro rata share of building common areas (including the public areas, shared hallways, shared restrooms, public stairwells, elevator lobbies)
  - **Load Factor**: rentable area divided buy usable area (a lower ratio is more efficient)
  - **Parking**: specific parking spaces can be assigned to a tenant or per thousand square feet of rented space
    - Parking charges can be added to the rent or included
  - **Office Leases**: anchor tenants, signage, parking, expansion option, purchase option or right of first refusal, overloading, gross/net/expense stops
  - **Retail Leases**: anchor tenants, signage, parking, co-tenancy clause, exclusivity, radius clause, termination or kick-out rights, operating times, and CAM charges



## Lecture 7: Valuation of Income Properties and Appraisal

- **Market Value**: the price at which a willing buyer and a willing seller, each without undue pressure, would buy and sell a particular property, as of a particular date
  - The sale must actually happen

- **Appraised Value**: an estimate or opinion of property value, for a particular purpose as of a particular date, by a particular appraiser
  - The three primary appraisal methods are: sales comparison, capitalization of income, and replacement cost
  - Each of the three appraisal methods should, in theory, produce a similar valuation
  - Hypothetical
  - Understanding that human nature wants to buy at a reasonable value => you don't want to overpay
  - **Sales Comparison (or Comparable Sales)**: compares recent sales of highly comparable properties that are similar in location, size, age, construction quality, and other factors
    - This is generally the only method used for residential properties
    - One of the three methods used to appraise commercial properties
    - Accounts for small differences between each property

- **Capitalization of Income**: gross rent multiplier, capitalization of net operating income, and discounted present value (DCF) of projected future annual NOI

  - Commercial properties are bought for the income they generate
  - **Gross Rent Multiplier**: `Annual Rental Income x Gross Rent Multiplier = Price/Value`
    - `Annual Rental Income`: doesn't include expenses, just the revenue
    - `Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)`: derived from the GRMs on sales of comparable properties in the area
      - Can be derived with data on annual rental income and sale price
      - Determined by the appraiser
      - Usually a whole number
      - Higher GRM => higher price => hotter real estate market

    - 1-year stabilized analysis
    - This simple method is often used for valuing apartments

  - **Capitalization of NOI**: `Cap Rate = NOI / Price`, so `NOI / Cap Rate = Price` and `Cap Rate x Price = NOI`
    - `Cap Rate`: capitalization rate; derived from recent sales of comparable properties and is affected by market conditions
      - Usually a small percent
      - Cap rates follow interest rates
        - Falling interest rates will tend to lower cap rates, while rising interest rates will increase cap rates
      - Cap rates are inversely correlated with price
        - Asset values are inversely correlated with interest rates => as interest rates rise, the amount of debt you can take on decreases => prices fall
      
      - An increase in demand relative to supply in the local market will lower cap rates, while an increase in supply relative to demand will raise cap rates
        - Increase in demand => higher price => lower cap rates and vice versa
      
    - `NOI`: net operating income
      - Differs from rental income by accounting for expenses (`NOI = Revenue - Expenses`)
    - 1-year stabilized analysis
    
  - **Discounted Present Value (DCF)**: a 10-year cash flow model is typically created
    - Typically doesn't happen, except for pretty sizable properties; more expensive
    - The discount rate used (or required internal rate of return) is based on the buyer's subjective assessment of the risk of achieving the projected future NOI and projected future sale price relative to current alternative investments and capital market benchmarks
    - Appearance of precision, very complex
      - Far more imprecise in some ways due to increased scale of predictions


  - **Replacement Cost**: the sum of `Land Value + Depreciated Replacement Cost of the Improvements`
    - What would it cost to build the property today?
    - May be different than capitalization of income, due to the value of things like leases that aren't explicitly tied to the property
      - Worry if the replacement cost is significantly lower than the capitalization of income estimate
    - The replacement cost approach is more reliable when the improvements are relatively new
      - Older buildings require large depreciation numbers, which are backed by relatively little data
    - **Land Value**: a "highest and best use" analysis to determine the value of a particular land site, whether the land is vacant or improved
      - Derived from a comparable sales analysis of similar land parcels
        - Model on parking lots, which are essentially worth their land value, as they don't generate income
      - A particular land parcel might actually be worth more if the existing improvements are demolished and removed
        - If this is the case, the demolition cost is included
    - Depreciation of the building can come from physical depreciation, functional obsolescence, and external obsolescence
      - Physical depreciation: paint chipping off, carpets thin, etc.
      - Functional obsolescence: bathrooms too small, features don't meet standards of the current marketplace
      - External obsolescence: new sewage treatment plant was installed upwind of your building



## Lecture 8: Investment Analysis and Taxation of Income Properties

- **Investment Benefits**: cash flow (after taxes), price appreciation, diversification
  - The cash flow is taxable => look at cash flow after taxing
    - Have a significant partner in all investments => the government

  - Price Appreciation: looking for prices to grow over time
    - Dependent on the specific investment, investments don't always appreciate in value
  - Diversification: multiple investments with the hope of offsetting poor investments

- **Real Estate Cycle**: the real estate industry is cyclical, with periods of growth and periods of decline in rents, occupancy, and property values
  - Cycle length is dynamic
  - The industry is very large and highly competitive, with many owners and limited concentration of ownership
- **Investment Strategies**: risk/return focus (core, value-added, or opportunistic), property type (e.g., office, retail, apartments, hotels), and/or geographical focus
  - Risk/Return
    - Core: low risk/low return
    - Value-Added: medium risk/medium return
    - Opportunistic: high risk/high return
      - Ex) Development deals

    - On average over time, higher returns should be expected with higher risk, but this isn't always true
    - Market rising => higher risk more likely to outperform, vice versa

  - Property/Geographic focus relies on an expertise in a specific area of investment
    - Specialist > generalist

  - Can work in some combination of all 3 => harder due to lack of expertise

- **Market Analysis**: supply/demand analysis or property type and local market, and local absorption projections to forecast future occupancy rates and rent levels
  - Absorption: the forecast of tenant leasing activity in the given market

- **Leverage**: the use of debt to acquire or own property
  - Real estate assets are large, so they are almost always financed by debt

- **Loan to Value Ratio (LTV)**: `Mortgage Balance / Property Value/Price`
  - `Mortgage Balance`: the principal balance of the loan at the time of calculation
  - The rest of the value is made up for by the equity investment/down payment

- **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)**: `Annual NOI / Annual Mortgage Payment`
  - A higher DSCR shows a greater ability for the borrower to make mortgage payments
    - Lenders want a cushion above 1.0 for the DSCR to account for potential failure
- **Net Operating Income (NOI)**: `Property Income - Operating Expenses`
  - `Property Income`: rental income and other income directly from the property
  - NOI is often capitalized to determine the market value of a property
  - Before debt and taxes

- **Before Tax Cash Flow**: `NOI - (Debt Service + Capital Expenditures)`
  - `Debt Service`: interest and principal
  - `Capital Expenditures`: repairs, improvements, etc.

- **After Tax Cash Flow**: `Before Tax Cash Flow - Taxes`
  - The government is your partner in every investment through its power to tax the annual income and capital gains from sale
  - Federal, state, local, and all other taxes must be considered
- **Taxable Income**: `NOI - (Interest + Tax Depreciation)`
  - `Interest`: only the interest portion of the periodic loan payments
    - The principal payments aren't deductible under tax law

  - **Tax Depreciation**: the amount of the purchase price allocated to the improvements, exclusive of the land, is the depreciable cost bases of the property
    - Appraisal of partitioning is based on rational metrics
    - The depreciable cost basis can be amortized as tax depreciation over 27.5 years for residential income properties and 39 years for non-residential income properties
      - Residential income properties (apartments) have a more favorable amortization

    - You want more tax depreciation, as it acts as an offset to the taxable income

- **Mortgage Interest Deduction**: the interest portion of the monthly P&I payments is tax deductible for primary and secondary homes on loans totaling up to $750,000
  - Applies to your personal income tax return

- **Unleveraged Returns vs. Leveraged Returns**: the internal rate of return (IRR), return on equity (ROE), and equity multiple from an investment before and after the effect of mortgage financing
  - Equity: the amount paid without loans
  - The leveraged returns should generally be higher than the unleveraged returns to account for the additional risk from the use of leverage

- Most investment property loans are balloon payment loans
  - Homes are less risky, so lenders are more willing to use fully-amortizing loans for them



## Lecture 9: Financial Leverage and Risk Analysis

- Financial Leverage
  - **Financial Leverage**: allows an investor to use less equity to acquire an investment, potentially achieve a higher leveraged return on equity, and benefit from the tax deductibility of mortgage interest
    - Investors who desire a higher leveraged return on equity might borrow at a higher LTV ratio, but as the LTV increases, risk increases
  - **Positive and Negative Leverage**: positive leverage is when the return on equity is higher with debt than without, and negative leverage is when the return on equity is lower with debt than without
    - With positive leverage, the higher the LTV ratio, the higher the leveraged return on equity
      - Higher LTVs result in more risk for the lender, so they'll likely bump interest rates up to offset the risk, offsetting the increase in ROE
    - With negative leverage, the higher the LTV ratio, the lower the leveraged return on equity
  - **Loan Underwriting**: The loan to value ratio (LTV) and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) are two of the key elements of a loan underwriting
    - Although the maximum LTV ratio and minimum DSCR levels vary with mortgage market conditions, lenders are always more secure with a lower LTV ratio and a higher DSCR
      - Smaller loan, higher coverage
  - **Prepayment Penalties, Yield Maintenance, Loan Lockouts**: mortgage loan terms that make it costly or impossible for a borrower to payoff or refinance a loan before the contract maturity date
    - Prepayment Penalties: you can pay off your loan early at an extra cost
      - Want to be close to 0
    - Yield Maintenance: pay off loan early while also paying off unpaid yields at a US Treasury rate
    - Loan Lockout: you cannot negotiate to pay your loan off early
  - **Interest-Only Loan (IO Loan)**: borrower pays only interest on the loan, with no principal amortization, and a balloon payment due at maturity
    - Also called a "bullet loan"
  - **Negative Amortizing Loan**: when the payment rate on a loan is less than the accrual rate (i.e., interest amount then due), there will be negative amortization and the loan balance will increase based on the remaining interest rate
    - Might be used when interest rates are very high
    - Can occur due to missed payments, resulting in interest being added to the loan balance
  - **Participating Loan**: the lender receives additional interest, based on a formula, typically related to gross income, NOI, or cash flow, that is called a participation or "equity kicker" but the lender doesn't have any ownership interest in the property
    - Partnership-type risk based on a formula
    - Not true equity, the lender doesn't take ownership liabilities
  - **Convertible Mortgage**: when the lender has the right to convert part or all of the loan principal to an ownership interest in the property at a specified time
    - Lender wants the option, not the obligation
  - **Mezzanine Loan**: a loan that is often secured by the owner's equity in a property, rather than by a mortgage on the property itself
    - Usually requires an inter-creditor agreement between the mezzanine lender and the first mortgage lender
      - First mortgage lender has to consent to the possibility of dealing with the mezzanine lender
    - Can be a traditional second mortgage
    - Lender can become the owner if the loan is failed to be paid back, dealing with the first mortgage lender
      - Doesn't trigger a foreclosure, like a traditional second mortgage would
  - **Preferred Equity**: an investment in the ownership interest of a property, that is not a mortgage, with a preferred return that takes priority over other equity investors
    - Has nothing securing the investment
    - Bringing in of investors for stability
    - Preferred investors have priority before other investors
  - **Sale-Leaseback**: an alternate means of monetizing a property where the seller retains use of the property for the duration of the lease term
    - With a repurchase option in the lease, the seller may reacquire ownership of the property in the future
- Risk Analysis
  - **Risk**: the higher the variability of expected returns, the greater the risk of an investment
    - The lower the variability of expected returns, the lower the risk 
  - **Risk Averse**: investors are generally risk averse, which means they require a higher expected return (probability weighted mean return) as compensation for incurring more risk (i.e., higher variability/volatility/uncertainty of expected returns)
  - **Risk vs. Return**: this is the key investment consideration
    - When comparing potential investments, their internal rate of return (IRR) or projected net present value (NPV) must be viewed in light of the risks associated with each potential investment
  - **Investment Risks**: economic risk (global, national, and local), business risk, financial risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, inflation risk, management risk, environmental risk, legislative risk, pandemic risk, etc.
  - **Due Diligence**: the process of identifying the various risks and potential returns of an investment by evaluating all the relevant and available information to assess and determine whether the potential returns are sufficient for you in light of those risks
    - Subjective assessment, imperfect process
    - Due diligence on a property should always include a review and analysis of a market study, the rent roll, major leases, physical inspection, design and engineering, title and survey, zoning and code compliance, taxes, insurance, litigation, etc.
  - **Sensitivity Analysis**: modifying key assumptions about future investment performance (e.g., rent levels, CPI, vacancy rates, exit cap rate, sale timing), often done two at a time, to see their impact on the IRR and equity multiple
    - The assumptions can be changed to model various scenarios in light of the potential risks
    - The sensitivity analysis will show how sensitive the expected return (e.g., IRR, NPV, or equity multiple) is to changes in your assumptions
  - **Partitioning the IRR**: determining the portion of the investment return that comes from the annual cash flow and the portion that comes from the sale/residual value



## Lecture 10: Disposition/Renovation of Income Properties

- **Exit Strategies**: to realize the increased equity value created from an appreciated property, an owner may sell, exchange or refinance the property
  - Mostly for investors who own commercial properties
- **Hold/Sell Analysis**: analyze the marginal rate of return from holding the property for an additional period of time as compared to selling the property currently
  - Usually done for an incremental period of time (often a year)
  - Sell if you believe you're topped out right now
  - If you sell, how do you sell?
- **Property Sale**: sell for cash and pay off all outstanding debt and pay all federal, state, and local taxes on any capital gain (see IRS Form 1040 and Schedule D)
- **Installment Sale**: sell on an installment sale basis receiving the sale price over time and paying a proportional amount of the capital gain tax with each installment received
  - The amount of installment sale income to be reported each year upon which tax must be paid is a function of the ratio between the “gross profit” on the sale (i.e. `Sale Price - Adjusted Tax Basis`) divided by the “contract price” as defined in IRS Form 6252
  - An installment sale is a form of seller financing
    - No one in the market is willing to pay the purchase price => seller finances the purchase by spreading payments out
  - Not something sellers want to do because they typically want the cash today
- **Section 1031 Exchange**: trade the property for “like kind” property in a U.S. Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 exchange transaction to defer the taxes on any capital gain but with the exchange property receiving a substituted tax basis
  - Section 1031 requires that the exchange property be identified within 45 days of the prior sale closing date, and the exchange property must be acquired within 180 days of the prior sale closing date
    - Up to 3 deals can be identified, since not all deals are closed
  - “Unlike” property acquired in a Section 1031 transaction is called “boot” and is subject to capital gain taxes on the sale
    - “Boot” includes cash, personal property, and any “unlike” real property received in the transaction (see IRS Form 8824)
  - Awkward because an exchange is usually done when the market is expected to fall, but in that case, the new property's value would also fall
- **Refinancing**: replacing an existing loan with a new loan
  - If you refinance with a larger loan you will not pay any tax on the additional loan proceeds received in 
    connection with the refinancing
  - If interest rates have fallen, it might be possible to refinance with a larger loan while reducing the annual borrowing cost, but points, appraisal fees, and other loan costs must be considered
- **Renovation**: as an alternative to a sale, a 1031 exchange, or a refinancing, the property may be held and renovated to increase rents, increase occupancy, and/or reduce operating costs, all of which should increase the NOI and thereby increase the property value
  - But in addition to the estimated renovation costs, the time, effort and opportunity costs related to the renovation must also be carefully considered. 




## Lecture 11: Financing Corporate Real Estate

- **Lease vs. Own Analysis**: decision factors include: space needed (relative to the size of the property), time needed (short term or long term), risk from property ownership, control and management of the property, maintenance and special purpose buildings, tax considerations from depreciation, impact on the financial statements (balance sheet and income statement), access to and cost of capital
  - Decision whether to buy the property or just lease it
  - Space needed => vary on size of company
  - Time needed => depends on company outlook
  - Control => how much do you want to change the building to match the company image?
  - Tax => offset income from tax depreciation shelter, but now have to deal with GAAP depreciation
  - Cost => oftentimes too expensive to buy real estate as opposed to working towards the company's primary objective (product, team, etc.)
- **Residual Value**: a property's projected future residual value (aka "exit value") may not be an important part of a company's purchase decision
  - Instead of acquiring a property that it needs to run its business, a company could negotiate a lease with an "equity kicker" or a purchase option that might provide future value
    - Equity kicker/participation interest: by becoming a tenant in a time of stress in the market, the tenant may get a "return on investment" by acquiring a portion of the building's future appreciation
  - May not have much value since the building is a physical asset that helps the company continue operating
- **Corporate Real Estate Financing**: the acquisition of property for company use can be financed with either mortgage debt or unsecured corporate borrowing
  - Mortgage debt will generally be preferred if it is cheaper than the company's unsecured borrowing cost
    - Mortgage in CA => deed of trust
  - For corporate borrowing, the corporation is evaluated based on its corporate signature, with no security instrument
    - For high credit companies, can be a higher percentage of the purchase price than a real estate loan with very low interest rates
- **"Capital" Lease**: formerly, if a lease term exceeded 75% of an asset's remaining economic life, or if the present value of future lease payments was the majority of the property's FMV at lease commencement (90%+), or if property ownership was likely to be transferred to the lessee upon lease expiration (e.g., a purchase option substantially below FMV), then the lease was treated as a "capital lease" and reported as if that part of the asset was owned by the lessee
- **"Finance" vs. "Operating" Lease**: under the recent ASC 842 of the FASB, the present value of all lease payments for leases over one year must be capitalized and reported on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, and annual lease payments will be reported as an expense on the company's income statement
  - If the lease term is one year or less, lease payments will only be reported on the company's income statement and not on the balance sheet
- **Sale-Leaseback**: a company might sell a property it owns and simultaneously lease it back on a long=term basis to obtain cash while retaining use of the property
  - The company might negotiate a repurchase option into the lease to give it the possibility to reacquire that property in the future
  - Selling a property and leasing it back in a sale-leaseback transaction, with the lease written so that it will be reported as an operating lease, is a form of off balance sheet financing for the company
- **"Hidden" Corporate Real Estate Value**: companies are required to report property values at the lower of depreciated cost or market value
  - This can lead a publicly traded company to become an acquisition target when the market value of its properties substantially exceeds the reported depreciated book value



## Lecture 12: Financing Project Development

- **Project Development**: acquiring a land site; financing and construction of a building (office, apartments, shopping center, warehouse, hotel, self storage, etc.); leasing and managing the property; then selling, exchanging, or refinancing
  - Riskiest aspect of real estate => building something that doesn't exist yet
  - Hope that the demand for the constructed space is high when the project is finished
- **Mixed-Use Development**: a combination of real estate uses in a single project
- **Development Decision Factors**: global, national, and local economic forecast; supply and demand for space (i.e., tenant demand); competition from other current and planned developments; capital markets (i.e., financing cost and availability)
- **Project Feasibility**: a feasibility study should be done to forecast tenant demand, rent levels, construction costs, project timing, exit strategies and future sales price, and evaluate the risks
  - Location is always a key factor in the analysis
- **Construction Financing**: convers the hard costs and soft costs of construction
  - Construction loans are disbursed in draws after costs are incurred, are typically recourse to the developer, are usually short term (maturing after construction is expected to be completed), and floating rate with construction interest capitalized into the outstanding loan balance
  - Construction lenders want a permanent lender ("take-out" lender) in place to pay off and replace the construction loan when construction is completed and various leasing targets have been achieved
  - A stand-by lender is a permanent lender who doesn't intend to actually fund their loan
- **Project Development Issues**: building: footprint, envelope, façade, stacking plan; traffic mitigation plan; property taxes; permitting: zoning codes, building codes
- **Permitting**: the process of obtaining local government approvals (e.g., city planning, city council) to permit the proposed development
  - The project must comply with local zoning codes and building codes (or obtain a variance) for a building permit to be issued
    - Can take years to make it through bureaucracy 
  - The permitting process involves negotiation with city planners and their staff
- **Zoning Codes**: allowable uses; maximum floor area ratio (FAR); height restrictions; minimum lot size; minimum parking ratios; building setbacks, etc.
  - Zoning codes specify what may be permitted to be built as of right (e.g., R1, R2, R3, R4, R-5, C-1, C-2, C-3, M-1, M-2, M-3, A-1, A-2, etc.) and may include incentive zoning, inclusionary zoning, and/or cumulative zoning
- **Building Codes**: specify the materials and approved methods for construction
  - City staff must approve the architectural and engineering designs and specifications for the project, including the site plan, elevations, and project renderings
  - Code compliance is enforced by city inspectors during construction before a certificate of occupancy ("C of O") will be issued by the local authority after project completion in compliance with all building codes and zoning codes




## Lecture 13: Financing Land Development

- **Land Development**: a highly fragmented, competitive, and local business
- **Land Acquisition**: option agreements are often used to give time to the land developer to pursue the entitlement process
  - Periodic option payments can be made over an extended time frame (monthly, quarterly, annually), and if the developer ultimately exercises the option, the option price for the land will be paid at the closing of the land acquisition

- **Zoning and Land Use**: city or county land use plans specify the allowed uses for each land parcel (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, special purpose, etc.) with subcategories for allowed density of use (e.g., R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, C-1, C-2, C-3, M-1, M-2, M-3, A-1, A-2, etc.)
  - The local land use plan is usually updated every 5-10 years, and the local zoning code can be revised, in whole or in part, whenever necessary

- **Entitlement Process**: the process by which the land developer applies to the local authorities to convert unentitled land to land that is entitled to be subdivided and developed for a particular purpose and size (office, apartments, shopping center, warehouse, hotel, etc.)
  - Developing a project that is inconsistent with the local zoning code and land use plan requires a variance from the local planning authorities

- **Land Financing**: difficult to obtain, low LTVs, generally recourse to the borrower and with tight conditions from the lender to assure repayment
- **Release Schedule**: the time frame within which the lender expects the individual land parcels in a land development project to be sold according to release prices agreed to in the land loan documents so that the loan will be repaid
- **Release Prices**: the pre-agreed minimum prices at which the developer can sell individual land parcels and obtain the lender's release from its blanket mortgage lien for the land parcels sold
- **Onsite Improvements**: land grading, internal paving, private streets, lighting, landscaping, etc.
- **Offsite Improvements**: public roads, street lighting, traffic lights, sewer line extensions, parks and schools, etc.
